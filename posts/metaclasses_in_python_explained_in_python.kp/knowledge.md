### Definition
Metaclasses are the classes of classes. They are used to create classes and define their behavior. They are used to create objects that can be used to create other objects.

### Usage
Metaclasses are used to customize the class creation process. They are used to modify the class before it is created. This can be used to add methods, properties, or even change the name of the class.

### Benefits
Using metaclasses allows developers to customize the behavior of a class without having to modify the code. This makes the code more maintainable and easier to understand. It also allows developers to create classes with more specific behavior than would be possible with traditional classes.

### Examples
One example of a metaclass is the type() function. This function can be used to create classes with custom behavior. It can also be used to modify existing classes. For example, if a class has a method that needs to be modified, type() can be used to modify the method without having to modify the code of the class.
