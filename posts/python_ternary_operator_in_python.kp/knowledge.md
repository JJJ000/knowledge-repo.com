Yes, Python does have a ternary conditional operator.

### Syntax
The ternary operator in Python has the following syntax:

```python
result = expression1 if condition else expression2
```

### Example
The following is an example of the ternary operator in action:

```python
x = 5
result = "positive" if x > 0 else "negative"
print(result)
```

The above code will print "positive" to the console.

### Usage
The ternary operator is most commonly used to simplify if-else statements. It can be used to assign a variable based on a boolean expression, or to evaluate an expression based on the value of a variable.
