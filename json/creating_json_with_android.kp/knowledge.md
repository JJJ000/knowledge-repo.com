### Creating a JSON Array
A JSON array is an ordered collection of values. Each value can be a string, number, boolean, null, object, or another array.

To create a JSON array, you need to enclose the array within square brackets (`[ ]`). Each element within the array is separated by a comma (`,`).

Example:
```json
[
    "Apple",
    "Banana",
    "Cherry"
]
```

### Creating a JSON Object
A JSON object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. The keys are strings and the values can be strings, numbers, boolean, null, objects, or arrays.

To create a JSON object, you need to enclose the object within curly brackets (`{ }`). Each key-value pair is separated by a comma (`,`).

Example:
```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 30,
    "isMarried": true
}
```
