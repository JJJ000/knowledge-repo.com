# Section 1: Overview
JSON.parse unexpected character error is an error that occurs when a character other than the expected one is encountered when parsing a JSON string. This error can be caused by a number of different issues, such as invalid JSON syntax, invalid characters, or missing quotes. 

# Section 2: Causes
1. Invalid JSON Syntax: If the JSON string contains an invalid syntax, the parser will throw an unexpected character error. This can be caused by missing commas, brackets, or quotes.
2. Invalid Characters: The JSON parser will throw an unexpected character error if it encounters a character that is not allowed in a JSON string. This can be caused by including HTML tags or other non-JSON characters in the string.
3. Missing Quotes: If a JSON string is missing a required quote, the parser will throw an unexpected character error.

# Section 3: Solution
The best way to resolve a JSON.parse unexpected character error is to check the JSON string for any invalid syntax, invalid characters, or missing quotes. Once these errors have been corrected, the JSON string should parse correctly.

# Section 4: Conclusion
