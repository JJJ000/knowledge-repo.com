# Purpose

The purpose of quoting names in JSON is to ensure that the names are interpreted as strings. This helps to differentiate the names from other types of data, such as numbers or booleans.

# Syntax

JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language and follows a specific set of rules for formatting data. Quoting names is part of this syntax and is necessary for the data to be properly interpreted.

# Readability

Quoting names in JSON also helps to improve readability. Without the quotes, it can be difficult to tell which pieces of data are names and which are values. Quoting names makes it easier to distinguish between the two.

# Consistency

Finally, quoting names in JSON helps to maintain consistency. By following the same syntax rules for all data, it makes it easier for developers to read and understand the data.
