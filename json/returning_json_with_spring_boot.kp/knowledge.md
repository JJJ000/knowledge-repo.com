[TOC]

## Section 1: Overview
Spring Boot provides a variety of ways to return JSON objects as a response. Spring Boot uses the Jackson library to automatically convert objects to JSON and vice versa. It also provides a number of features to customize the JSON output.

## Section 2: Using @ResponseBody Annotation
The most common way to return a JSON object from a Spring Boot application is to use the @ResponseBody annotation. This annotation can be applied to a method to indicate that the return value should be serialized into JSON and sent back to the client.

## Section 3: Using @RestController Annotation
The @RestController annotation is a specialized version of the @Controller annotation. It is used to indicate that the class is a REST controller and all the methods in it should return a JSON object.

## Section 4: Customizing the JSON Output
Spring Boot provides a number of features to customize the JSON output. These features include customizing the field names, ignoring certain fields, and transforming certain fields. These features can be enabled by using the @JsonView annotation.
