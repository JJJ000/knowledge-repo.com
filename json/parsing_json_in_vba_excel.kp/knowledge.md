# Section 1: Overview

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate. Excel VBA can be used to parse JSON data and access data within it.

# Section 2: Parsing JSON

When parsing JSON data in Excel VBA, there are two main ways to do it: using the native VBA JSON parser or using third-party libraries.

# Section 3: Native VBA JSON Parser

The native VBA JSON parser is the simplest and easiest way to parse JSON in Excel VBA. It is available in Excel 2016 and later versions. It is easy to use and can be used to quickly parse JSON data.

# Section 4: Third-Party Libraries

Third-party libraries such as VBA-JSON and JSONConverter can be used to parse JSON data in Excel VBA. These libraries are more powerful and can be used to parse more complex JSON data. However, they also require more setup and are more resource intensive.
