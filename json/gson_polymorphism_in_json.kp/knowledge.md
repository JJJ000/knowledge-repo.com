tldr: Gson supports polymorphic serialization and deserialization of objects, allowing objects of different types to be serialized and deserialized in the same JSON structure.

# Section 1: What is Polymorphism?
Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming languages that allows for the same code to be used for different types of objects. It allows for the same code to be used for different objects, even if those objects are of different types.

# Section 2: What is Gson?
Gson is a Java library used to serialize and deserialize Java objects to and from JSON. It is a high-level library that provides an easy way to convert Java objects to JSON and vice versa.

# Section 3: How Does Gson Support Polymorphism?
Gson supports polymorphism by allowing developers to specify a type adapter that will be used to convert objects of the same type. This type adapter can be used to convert objects of different types to the same type, allowing for polymorphic behavior.

# Section 4: Benefits of Using Gson for Polymorphism
Using Gson for polymorphism allows for code reuse and a more efficient way of dealing with objects of different types. It also allows for better performance as the type adapter can be used to convert objects of different types to the same type. This reduces the amount of code needed to be written, as well as the amount of code that needs to be maintained.
