# Section 1: Importing Libraries

In order to read a JSON object in Python, we need to import the json library. This can be done with the following code:

```python
import json
```

# Section 2: Loading the JSON Object

Once the json library has been imported, we can now load the JSON object. This can be done by using the json.load() method. This method takes a file-like object, such as a file opened in read mode, and returns the data in the file as a Python object. 

For example, if we have a JSON file called "example.json", we can load it with the following code:

```python
with open('example.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
```

# Section 3: Accessing JSON Data

Once the JSON object has been loaded, we can now access the data inside it. The data can be accessed using the standard Python dictionary syntax. For example, if our JSON object has an attribute called "name", we can access it with the following code:

```python
name = data['name']
```

# Section 4: Parsing JSON Data

Finally, we can parse the JSON data using the json.loads() method. This method takes a string as an argument and returns the data as a Python object. For example, if we have a JSON string called "example_string", we can parse it with the following code:

```python
data = json.loads(example_string)
```
