# Section 1: Obtain JsonNode Object

The first step to parsing a JSON string into a JsonNode is to obtain a JsonNode object. This can be done by using the Jackson library to parse the JSON string into a JsonNode object.

# Section 2: Create ObjectMapper

The next step is to create an ObjectMapper object. This ObjectMapper object is used to convert a JSON string into a JsonNode object.

# Section 3: Read Value

Once the ObjectMapper object is created, the readValue() method can be used to parse the JSON string into a JsonNode object. This method takes the JSON string as an argument and returns a JsonNode object.

# Section 4: Access JsonNode

Finally, the JsonNode object can be accessed using the get() method. This method takes a field name as an argument and returns the corresponding value from the JsonNode object.
