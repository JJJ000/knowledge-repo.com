### Section 1: Using an Array

One way to sort a JSON object by its values is to convert it into an array. This can be done by looping through the object and pushing each key-value pair into an array. Then, the array can be sorted using the JavaScript `sort()` method, which takes in a comparison function as an argument to determine the order of the elements.

### Section 2: Using Lodash

Another way to sort a JSON object by its values is to use the Lodash library. The `sortBy()` method provided by Lodash takes in an object and a comparison function as arguments, and returns a sorted array. This is a simpler and more efficient approach than the one mentioned above.

### Section 3: Using a Map

A third way to sort a JSON object by its values is to use a `Map` object. The `Map` object provides a `set()` method, which allows you to set key-value pairs in the map. Once the map is populated, it can be sorted using the `sort()` method, which takes in a comparison function as an argument.

### Section 4: Using a Library

Finally, there are several libraries available that provide functions for sorting JSON objects by their values. These libraries often provide additional features such as sorting by multiple keys, sorting by nested values, etc. Some popular libraries for this purpose include JsonQuery, JsonSort, and JsonOrder.
