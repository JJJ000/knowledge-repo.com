## Serialization
Boost provides a library for serializing and deserializing JSON. This library is called Boost.PropertyTree.

To serialize a JSON object, you must first create a property tree. A property tree is a tree-like data structure that stores key-value pairs. The keys are strings and the values can be strings, integers, or other data types.

Once you have created the property tree, you can then use the Boost.PropertyTree library to serialize the tree into a JSON string. The Boost.PropertyTree library provides functions for serializing the tree into either a JSON string or a JSON file.

## Deserialization

Deserializing a JSON object is the process of taking a JSON string and converting it back into a property tree. To do this, you must first create an empty property tree.

Once you have an empty property tree, you can then use the Boost.PropertyTree library to deserialize the JSON string into the tree. The library provides functions for deserializing either a JSON string or a JSON file.

Once the tree has been deserialized, you can then access the key-value pairs stored in the tree.

## Conclusion

Serializing and deserializing JSON with Boost is a straightforward process. By using the Boost.PropertyTree library, you can easily convert JSON strings into property trees and vice versa. This makes it easy to store and access data stored in JSON format.
