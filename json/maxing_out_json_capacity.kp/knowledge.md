## Size Limit

The size of a JSON document is not limited. It is only limited by the maximum size of the data structures that can be used to store it. This is usually determined by the memory and storage capacity of the system on which the JSON document is stored.

## Data Type Limitation

JSON documents can only contain data of certain types. These types include strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and null.

## Character Limit

JSON documents have a maximum character length of 4,096 characters. This is the maximum number of characters that can be stored in a single JSON document.

## Nesting Limit

JSON documents can be nested to any level. However, the maximum nesting level should be kept to a reasonable level to ensure that the document can be parsed and processed efficiently.
