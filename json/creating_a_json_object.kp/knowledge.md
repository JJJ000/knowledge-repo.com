1. Create a JSON String 

Creating a JSON string is the first step to creating a JSON object. A JSON string is a valid string representation of a JSON object. A JSON string is composed of key-value pairs and must be enclosed in double quotes. The keys must be strings and the values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, true/false, or null. 

2. Parse the JSON String 

Once you have created a valid JSON string, you can parse the string into a JSON object. This can be done with the JSON.parse() method. This method takes the JSON string as an argument and returns a JavaScript object. 

3. Access the Object Properties 

Once the JSON string has been parsed into a JavaScript object, you can access the object properties using dot notation or bracket notation. 

4. Modify the Object 

You can also modify the object by adding, updating, or deleting properties. To add a new property, use the dot or bracket notation to assign a value to the new property. To update a property, assign a new value to the existing property. To delete a property, use the delete keyword.
