1. Overview

A String-argument constructor or factory method is a method that takes a String value as an argument and returns an object of a specific type. It is commonly used to deserialize a String value from a JSON format into an object.

2. Deserializing from JSON

Deserializing from JSON involves taking a String value in JSON format and creating an object from it. This can be done using a String-argument constructor or factory method. The method takes the JSON String as an argument and returns an object of the desired type.

3. Example

For example, consider the following JSON String: 

```json
"{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30
}"
```

This JSON String can be deserialized into an object of type Person using a String-argument constructor or factory method. The method takes the JSON String as an argument and returns an object of type Person with the name and age fields set to the values provided in the JSON String.

4. Conclusion

In conclusion, a String-argument constructor or factory method can be used to deserialize a String value from a JSON format into an object. This method takes the JSON String as an argument and returns an object of the desired type.
