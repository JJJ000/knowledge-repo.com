### Section 1: Create a Django view

In order to create a JSON response using Django and Python, the first step is to create a Django view. To do so, create a view in the views.py file of the Django project. The view should take a request and return a response.

The following example shows a view that returns a JSON response containing a list of strings:

```python
from django.http import JsonResponse

def my_view(request):
    data = ["string1", "string2", "string3"]
    return JsonResponse(data, safe=False)
```

### Section 2: Create a URL

The next step is to create a URL for the view. To do this, add a URL pattern to the urls.py file of the Django project. The URL pattern should map the view to a URL path.

The following example shows a URL pattern that maps the my_view view to the /my-view/ URL path:

```python
from django.urls import path
from .views import my_view

urlpatterns = [
    path('my-view/', my_view, name='my_view'),
]
```

### Section 3: Make a request

Now that the view and URL have been created, the next step is to make a request to the URL. This can be done using a web browser or a tool such as cURL.

The following example shows a cURL request that makes a GET request to the /my-view/ URL path:

```bash
curl http://example.com/my-view/
```

### Section 4: View the response

When the request is made, the view will be executed and a response will be returned. The response will be in the form of a JSON object containing the data from the view.

The following example shows the JSON response from the my_view view:

```json
["string1", "string2", "string3"]
```
