Possible explanation:

1. What is JSON.parse?
JSON.parse is a built-in JavaScript function that allows you to convert a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) string into a JavaScript object.

2. What does the error message mean?
The error message "expected property name or '}' in JSON" usually occurs when the JSON string that you are trying to parse is not valid, and does not follow the syntax rules of JSON. Property names in JSON must be enclosed in double quotes, and followed by a colon and a value. Also, all objects in JSON must be enclosed in curly braces, and all arrays must be enclosed in square brackets.

3. How to fix the error?
To fix the error, you need to check the JSON string for syntax errors and correct them. Here are some common mistakes that can cause the error:

- Missing or mismatched quotes around property names: Make sure that all property names are enclosed in double quotes, and that there are no missing or extra quotes that can cause confusion.

- Missing or misplaced colons: Make sure that each property name is followed by a colon and a value, and that there are no missing or misplaced colons that can break the structure of the JSON object.

- Missing or extra curly braces or square brackets: Make sure that all objects are enclosed in curly braces, and all arrays are enclosed in square brackets. Also, make sure that there are no missing or extra braces or brackets that can cause confusion.

- Invalid values or types: Make sure that all values in the JSON object are valid and of the expected type (e.g. strings, numbers, Booleans, objects, arrays, or null).

- Mixed syntax: Make sure that there are no mixed syntax elements (e.g. using both commas and semicolons to separate values) that can cause confusion.

4. How to prevent the error?
To prevent the error, you should always make sure that your JSON strings follow the syntax rules of JSON, and that you validate them before trying to parse them. You can use online JSON validators or tools such as JSONLint or JSMin to check your JSON strings for syntax errors. Also, make sure that you handle any errors that may occur during the parsing process, and provide meaningful feedback to the user.
