**Contents**

[TOC]

No, you do not have to use arrays for everything in JSON.

Objects

JSON objects are collections of key/value pairs. The key is a string and the value can be a string, number, boolean expression, array, or another object. Objects are enclosed in curly braces and separated by commas.

Arrays

JSON arrays are collections of values. The values can be strings, numbers, boolean expressions, objects, or other arrays. Arrays are enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas.

When to Use Objects and Arrays

Objects are best used to represent a single entity, such as a person or a product. Arrays are best used to represent a collection of entities, such as a list of people or a list of products.

Conclusion

In conclusion, you do not have to use arrays for everything in JSON. Objects and arrays both have their place in a JSON document, and it is important to know when to use each one.
