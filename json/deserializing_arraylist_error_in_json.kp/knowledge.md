## Section 1: What is Deserialization?
Deserialization is the process of converting a serialized object (such as a JSON string) back into a live object that can be used by the program. It is the opposite of serialization, which is the process of converting an object into a string or other data format that can be stored or transmitted.

## Section 2: Json and Java
Java and JSON are both popular languages used in software development. Java is a programming language designed to create applications that can run on any platform, while JSON is a text-based data format used to store and exchange data.

## Section 3: Deserializing a Json String
When deserializing a JSON string into a Java object, the data must be converted from its string format into the format of the Java object. This is done by using a JSON library, such as Jackson or Gson, which can parse the string and convert it into an object.

## Section 4: Deserializing an ArrayList
When deserializing an ArrayList from a JSON string, the data must be converted from its string format into the format of an ArrayList. This is done by using a JSON library which can parse the string and convert it into an ArrayList object.
