## Section 1: Check for Exceptions

When deserializing a JSON response with Gson, it is important to check for exceptions. NumberFormatExceptions can occur when the data type of a field in the JSON response does not match the data type of the corresponding field in the Java object. This can happen if the JSON response contains a number that is too large or too small for the Java object's data type.

## Section 2: Catch the Exception

If a NumberFormatException is encountered, it should be caught and handled appropriately. This can be done by using a try-catch block to catch the exception and then handle it using the methods provided by the exception.

## Section 3: Handle the Exception

Once the exception has been caught, it can be handled by either re-attempting the deserialization, logging the exception, or providing a custom error message. Depending on the use case, the developer may choose to handle the exception differently.

## Section 4: Test the Code

Finally, it is important to test the code to ensure that the exception is handled properly. This can be done by running unit tests to check that the code is behaving as expected and that any exceptions are handled properly.
