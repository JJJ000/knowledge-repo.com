# Introduction

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format used to exchange data between different systems. It is widely used for its simplicity and flexibility and is supported by almost all modern web browsers.

# Browser-Native JSON Support

Modern web browsers have native support for JSON, allowing for easy and efficient data exchange. The browser-native JSON support is provided by the window.JSON object. This object provides methods for parsing and stringifying JSON data. It also provides methods for transforming JSON data into other formats, such as XML and HTML.

# Parsing and Stringifying

The window.JSON object provides two main methods for parsing and stringifying JSON data. The parse() method is used to parse JSON data and convert it into a JavaScript object. The stringify() method is used to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string.

# Transforming

The window.JSON object also provides methods for transforming JSON data into other formats, such as XML and HTML. The toXML() method is used to convert JSON data into an XML string. The toHTML() method is used to convert JSON data into an HTML string.
