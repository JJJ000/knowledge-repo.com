#### Section 1: Preparing the Ajax Call

In order to render a JSON object using a Django template after an Ajax call, the first step is to prepare the Ajax call. This involves creating the URL to the view, specifying the type of request (GET or POST), and adding any additional parameters or data that need to be sent to the view.

#### Section 2: Retrieving the JSON Object

Once the Ajax call has been prepared, the next step is to retrieve the JSON object from the view. This can be done by making a request to the URL specified in the Ajax call, and then retrieving the JSON object from the response.

#### Section 3: Rendering the JSON Object

Once the JSON object has been retrieved, it can then be rendered using a Django template. This can be done by passing the JSON object to the template context, and then using the template tags to render the data.

#### Section 4: Updating the View

Finally, once the template has been rendered, the view can be updated with the new data. This can be done by making an Ajax call to the same URL, passing the new data as parameters, and then updating the view with the new data.
