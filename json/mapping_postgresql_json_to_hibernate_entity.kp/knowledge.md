## Section 1: Setting up the PostgreSQL Database

The first step in mapping a PostgreSQL JSON column to a Hibernate entity property in Json is to set up the PostgreSQL database. This includes creating a database, creating a table, and defining the columns, including the JSON column. The JSON column should be defined as a `JSONB` data type, which allows for efficient storage and manipulation of JSON data. 

## Section 2: Creating the Hibernate Entity

The next step is to create a Hibernate entity that corresponds to the database table. This can be done by creating a Java class and annotating it with the `@Entity` annotation. The fields of the entity should correspond to the columns of the database table, and the JSON field should be defined as a `String` type. 

## Section 3: Configuring the Hibernate Mapping

The final step is to configure the Hibernate mapping for the entity. This is done by creating a mapping file (e.g. an `.hbm.xml` file) and defining the mapping for each field. For the JSON field, the `type` attribute should be set to `jsonb`, and the `column` attribute should be set to the name of the JSON column in the database table. 

## Section 4: Testing the Mapping

Once the mapping is configured, the mapping should be tested to ensure that it is working correctly. This can be done by writing some code to insert and retrieve data from the database. If the data is successfully inserted and retrieved, then the mapping is working correctly.
