## 1. Setting up the Request
Before sending the file, the client must make a request to the server. This request should contain the name of the file, as well as any other necessary information such as the file type and size. The client should also include any authentication information required for the server to accept the request.

## 2. Sending the File
Once the request is received, the server can then begin to send the file. Depending on the size of the file, the server may choose to send the file in chunks, or in its entirety. If the file is large, it may be beneficial to compress the file before sending it, as this will reduce the amount of time required to send the file.

## 3. Receiving the File
The client must be able to receive the file from the server. Depending on the size of the file, the client may choose to receive the file in chunks, or in its entirety. The client should also be able to check the integrity of the file by calculating the checksum.

## 4. Parsing the File
Once the file is received, the client must then parse the file. Depending on the file type, the client may choose to parse the file in different ways. For example, if the file is a text file, the client may choose to parse the file line by line. If the file is a JSON file, the client may choose to parse the file using a JSON parser.
