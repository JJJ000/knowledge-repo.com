# What is JSON?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is a text-based, human-readable format for representing simple data structures and associative arrays (called objects).

# What is JSON Used For?
JSON is used to store and exchange data between applications and web services. It is also used to transmit data between servers and web applications, as an alternative to XML. It is also used to serialize objects, arrays, numbers, strings, booleans, and null values.

# Advantages of JSON
JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format and is easy to read and write. It is also language independent, which makes it easier to work with different programming languages. Additionally, it is self-describing, which makes it easier to understand and use.

# Disadvantages of JSON
JSON does not support comments, which can make it difficult to document code. Additionally, it does not support data types such as dates, which can make it difficult to work with certain types of data. Finally, it is not as secure as other data formats, as it does not support encryption.
