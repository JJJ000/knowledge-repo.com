1. Setting up the POST Request

First, we need to set up the POST request to the Web API. This can be done using the `fetch` API, `XMLHttpRequest`, or any other HTTP client library. 

2. Preparing the JSON Data

Next, we need to prepare the JSON data that we want to send to the Web API. This can be done by creating a JavaScript object and then converting it to JSON format using `JSON.stringify()`. 

3. Setting the Request Body

Once the JSON data is prepared, we need to set the request body to the JSON data. This can be done by setting the `Content-Type` header to `application/json` and then setting the body of the request to the JSON data.

4. Sending the Request

Finally, we can send the request using the `fetch` API or any other HTTP client library. The Web API should receive the JSON data as an object.
