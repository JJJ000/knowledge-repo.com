### What is a JSON SyntaxError

A JSON SyntaxError occurs when the syntax of a JSON file is incorrect. This error is usually caused by an unexpected character, such as a colon (:), which does not conform to the JSON standard.

### What Causes the Unexpected Token Error

The Unexpected Token error is usually caused by an extra comma, colon, or other unexpected character in the JSON file. This can occur when a user has manually edited the file or when the file was generated incorrectly.

### How to Fix the Error

To fix the Unexpected Token error, the user should open the JSON file and look for the unexpected character. Once the character has been identified, the user should remove it and save the file.
