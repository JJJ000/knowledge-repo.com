### Step 1: Install the Requests Library
The Requests library is a popular Python library for making HTTP requests. To install it, use the following command:

`pip install requests`

### Step 2: Make the Request
Once the Requests library is installed, you can make a request to the RESTful service to get the JSON data. The following code snippet shows an example of how to do this:

```python
import requests

url = 'https://example.com/api/get_data'

response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    json_data = response.json()
```

### Step 3: Parse the JSON Data
Once you have the JSON data, you can parse it using the `json` module. The following code snippet shows an example of how to do this:

```python
import json

parsed_data = json.loads(json_data)
```

### Step 4: Access the Data
Once the JSON data has been parsed, you can access the data using the appropriate keys. The following code snippet shows an example of how to do this:

```python
for item in parsed_data:
    print(item['name'])
```
