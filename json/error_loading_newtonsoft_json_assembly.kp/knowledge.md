[TOC]

# Introduction
Newtonsoft.Json is a popular library for .NET applications that allow developers to easily serialize and deserialize objects to and from JSON. The error in the question suggests that there is a mismatch between the version of Newtonsoft.Json referenced by the application and the version of the assembly that is actually installed.

# Causes

This issue can occur due to a variety of reasons, including:

- Incorrectly referencing the wrong version of the assembly.
- Installing a different version of the assembly than the one referenced.
- An out-of-date version of the assembly being installed.

# Resolution

To resolve this issue, you should:

1. Check the version of the assembly being referenced in the application.
2. Install the correct version of the assembly.
3. Ensure that the assembly is up-to-date.
4. Check for any other mismatches between the application and the assembly.
