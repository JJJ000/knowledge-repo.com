1. Stringify the JavaScript Object

The first step to encoding a JavaScript object as JSON is to stringify it. This can be done using the `JSON.stringify()` method, which takes the JavaScript object as an argument and returns a JSON-formatted string.

2. Encode the JSON String

Once the JavaScript object has been stringified, it needs to be encoded as JSON. This can be done using the `JSON.encode()` method, which takes the JSON string as an argument and returns an encoded JSON string.

3. Parse the Encoded JSON String

Once the JSON string has been encoded, it needs to be parsed. This can be done using the `JSON.parse()` method, which takes the encoded JSON string as an argument and returns a parsed JSON object.

4. Output the Parsed JSON Object

The final step is to output the parsed JSON object. This can be done using the `console.log()` method, which takes the parsed JSON object as an argument and prints out the object in the console.
