## TEXT
The best SQL datatype for storing JSON string in JSON is `TEXT`. This datatype allows for the storage of strings up to 2GB in size, which is more than enough for the majority of JSON strings. 

## Advantages
The main advantage of using the `TEXT` datatype is that it allows for the storage of large strings without truncation. This is important when storing JSON strings, as truncation can lead to errors when the data is parsed. Additionally, the `TEXT` datatype is supported by most SQL databases, making it a convenient and reliable choice.

## Disadvantages
The main disadvantage of using the `TEXT` datatype is that it is not a native JSON datatype. This means that the data must be parsed before it can be queried or manipulated. Additionally, the `TEXT` datatype does not support indexing, which can cause performance issues when working with large datasets. 

## Alternatives
An alternative to the `TEXT` datatype is the `JSON` datatype, which is supported by some SQL databases. This datatype allows for the storage of JSON strings without the need for parsing, and also supports indexing. However, the `JSON` datatype is not supported by all SQL databases, so it may not be a viable option for some users.
