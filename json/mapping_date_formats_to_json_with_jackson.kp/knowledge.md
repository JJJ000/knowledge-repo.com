## Section 1: Overview

The Jackson JSON library is a powerful and popular Java library used for transforming Java objects into JSON format. It provides a wide range of features and capabilities, including support for mapping Java Date objects to JSON. This is useful for applications that need to represent dates in a standard way, such as for web services and other applications that need to exchange data with other systems.

## Section 2: Date Formatting

Jackson provides a range of options for formatting dates when mapping them to JSON. The most basic option is to use the default formatting, which is based on the ISO 8601 standard. This is the most widely used standard for representing dates in JSON, and it ensures that dates are represented in a consistent format across all systems.

## Section 3: Custom Date Formats

In addition to the default date format, Jackson also allows developers to specify custom date formats. This is useful for applications that need to use a specific date format, or for applications that need to parse dates in a specific format. Custom date formats can be specified using the @JsonFormat annotation, which allows developers to specify a specific date format string.

## Section 4: Conclusion

Jackson provides an easy way to map Java Date objects to JSON. It supports the default ISO 8601 date format, as well as custom date formats. This makes it easy for developers to ensure that dates are represented in a consistent way across all systems.
