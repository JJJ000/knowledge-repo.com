## 1. Using Streaming

Streaming is a memory efficient and fast way to load big JSON files. It allows you to read data from a file or a stream in chunks and process each chunk as it is read. This way, only the necessary data is loaded into memory and the rest is discarded.

## 2. Using a JSON Parser

Using a JSON parser is another memory efficient and fast way to load big JSON files. A JSON parser can read the data from a file or stream in chunks and parse the data. This way, only the data that is necessary is loaded into memory and the rest is discarded.

## 3. Using a Database

Using a database is also a memory efficient and fast way to load big JSON files. A database can store the data from a file or stream in chunks and query the data as needed. This way, only the data that is necessary is loaded into memory and the rest is discarded.

## 4. Using a File Compression Tool

Using a file compression tool is also a memory efficient and fast way to load big JSON files. A file compression tool can compress the data from a file or stream, reducing the file size. This way, only the necessary data is loaded into memory and the rest is discarded.
