### Stringify the Object

The first step in printing a circular structure in a JSON-like format is to use the `JSON.stringify()` method. This method takes an object and converts it into a string. This string can then be printed in a JSON-like format.

### Replacer Function

The `JSON.stringify()` method also takes an optional argument, a `replacer` function. This function can be used to customize the stringification process. In the case of a circular structure, the replacer function should be used to detect and handle circular references.

### Circular Reference Detection

The replacer function should be used to detect circular references. This can be done by keeping track of objects that have already been stringified. If an object is encountered that has already been stringified, the replacer function should simply return `null` instead of stringifying the object again.

### Print the Result

Once the replacer function has been used to detect and handle circular references, the `JSON.stringify()` method can be used to stringify the object. The resulting string can then be printed in a JSON-like format.
