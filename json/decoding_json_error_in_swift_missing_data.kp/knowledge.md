## What is JSON
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is a text-based language-independent specification for data exchange. JSON is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language and is easy for humans to read and write.

## What is the "The data couldn’t be read because it is missing" Error
The "The data couldn’t be read because it is missing" error is a common error when decoding JSON in Swift. This error occurs when the JSON data is not properly formatted or is missing some of the required information.

## Causes of the Error
The most common causes of this error are:

1. The JSON data is not properly formatted.
2. The JSON data is missing some of the required information.
3. The data type of the value is incorrect.
4. The JSON data is not properly encoded.

## Solutions
To solve this error, make sure that the JSON data is properly formatted, contains all the required information, and is properly encoded. Additionally, make sure that the data type of the value is correct. If the problem persists, try using a different JSON parser or library.
