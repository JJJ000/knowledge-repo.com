### Deserialization

The process of deserializing JSON into a custom class is relatively simple. First, the JSON must be parsed into a data structure such as a dictionary or array. This can be done using the `json_decode()` function. Once the JSON has been parsed, the data can be iterated through and used to populate the fields of the custom class. 

### Mapping

The next step is to map the data from the parsed JSON to the fields of the custom class. This can be done by looping through the data structure and setting the fields of the class to the corresponding values from the JSON. This can be done either manually or by using a library such as json-mapper which provides an easy way to map JSON data to custom classes.

### Validation

Once the data has been mapped to the custom class, it is important to validate the data to make sure it is valid and conforms to the requirements of the class. This can be done by writing custom validation functions or by using a library such as json-schema which provides an easy way to validate JSON data.

### Serialization

Finally, the process is complete when the data is serialized back into JSON format. This can be done using the `json_encode()` function. This will return the data in a JSON format which can then be used as needed.
