tldr: There is no set limit on the size of a JSON object, but it is recommended to keep it small for performance reasons.

# No Explicit Limit

There is no explicit limit on the size of a JSON object. The size of a JSON object is limited only by the amount of available memory.

# Practical Limitations

While there is no explicit limit, there are practical considerations that may limit the size of a JSON object. For example, some web browsers have a maximum URL length, which may limit the size of a JSON object that is sent to a web server. Additionally, some web servers may impose a limit on the size of a request body.

# Performance Considerations

The size of a JSON object may also affect the performance of applications that use it. For example, large JSON objects may take longer to parse, serialize, and transmit than smaller objects. Additionally, large objects may require more memory to store, which could lead to memory exhaustion issues.

# Conclusion

Overall, there is no explicit limit on the size of a JSON object. However, practical considerations and performance issues may limit the size of a JSON object in some cases.
