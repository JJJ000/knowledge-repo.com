tldr: JWT is a more secure option for token-based authentication in JSON than cookies, as it is not stored on the client-side.

# JWT

JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are a type of token-based authentication that is used to transmit information between two parties securely. JWTs are self-contained and contain all the necessary information for authentication. They are cryptographically signed and can be used to verify the authenticity of the data.

# Advantages of JWT

- JWTs are stateless, meaning they do not require a database to store information or a session to keep track of user data.
- JWTs are signed, meaning that the data within them can be verified and trusted.
- JWTs are compact and can be sent over the internet quickly and easily.
- JWTs can be used to securely transmit data between two parties.

# Disadvantages of JWT

- JWTs are vulnerable to attacks such as replay attacks, where an attacker can intercept and replay a token to gain access to a system.
- JWTs are vulnerable to brute force attacks, where an attacker can guess the secret key used to sign the token.
- JWTs are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and modify the token before it is sent to the server.

# Cookies

Cookies are small pieces of data that are stored on the user’s computer by the web browser. They are used to store information such as user preferences, login credentials, and session data. Cookies are sent with each request to the server, allowing the server to identify the user and provide personalized content.

# Advantages of Cookies

- Cookies are easy to implement and use.
- Cookies are stateful, meaning that they can store information about the user’s session.
- Cookies are secure, as they are encrypted and can only be accessed by the server that issued them.

# Disadvantages of Cookies

- Cookies can be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, where an attacker can inject malicious code into the cookie to gain access to a system.
- Cookies are vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, where an attacker can intercept and modify the cookie before it is sent to the server.
- Cookies can be vulnerable to brute force attacks, where an attacker can guess the secret key used to encrypt the cookie.
