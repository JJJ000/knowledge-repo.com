tldr: It is not possible to add a JSON serializer to every model class in JSON as JSON is a data format, and not a programming language that allows you to add functionality to classes.

## Section 1: Introduction

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard data format that is used for exchanging data between a client and a server. When building a web application, it is common to use JSON as the format for transferring data between the front-end and backend. In this task, we will discuss how to add a JSON serializer to every model class in a Python application.

## Section 2: What is a JSON serializer?

A JSON serializer is a tool that converts Python objects to JSON formatted data so that it can be sent over the internet to another client or server. In Python, there are several libraries that can be used for serializing data to JSON. The most commonly used libraries are `json` and `simplejson`. These libraries provide functions that can convert Python objects to JSON and vice versa.

## Section 3: Implementing JSON serialization in model classes

To implement JSON serialization in model classes, we first need to import the JSON serialization library into our project. The most commonly used library for JSON serialization in Python is the `json` library. This library provides a `dumps()` function that can convert Python objects to JSON data.

We can then implement the JSON serialization logic in our model classes by defining a `to_json()` method that converts the model attributes to a Python dictionary and then passes it to the `json.dumps()` function.

```python
import json

class MyModel:
    def __init__(self, attr1, attr2):
        self.attr1 = attr1
        self.attr2 = attr2

    def to_json(self):
        return json.dumps({
            'attr1': self.attr1,
            'attr2': self.attr2
        })

my_model = MyModel('value1', 'value2')
my_model_json = my_model.to_json()
print(my_model_json)
```

The `to_json()` method converts the model attributes to a Python dictionary and then passes it to the `json.dumps()` function to convert it to a JSON formatted string. We can then store or transfer the JSON formatted string as needed.

## Section 4: Conclusion

In this task, we have discussed how to add a JSON serializer to every model class in a Python application. By implementing the JSON serialization logic in our model classes, we can easily convert our Python models to JSON formatted data and transfer it over the internet to other clients or servers. The `json` library provides a simple and easy-to-use interface for JSON serialization in Python.
