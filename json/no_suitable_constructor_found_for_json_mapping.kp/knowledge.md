**Section 1: Overview**

JsonMappingException is an exception that occurs when there is a problem mapping a JSON object to a Java class. It is thrown when Jackson is unable to find a suitable constructor for a given type. This exception is typically encountered when a JSON object contains an unexpected type or does not contain all the necessary fields to create an instance of the specified type.

**Section 2: Causes**

A JsonMappingException can be caused by a variety of issues, including:

- The JSON object does not contain all the necessary fields to create an instance of the specified type
- The JSON object contains an unexpected type
- The JSON object is malformed in some way
- The Java class does not have a suitable constructor

**Section 3: Solutions**

The solution to this issue depends on the cause of the exception. Generally, the following steps should be taken to resolve the issue:

- Ensure that the JSON object contains all the necessary fields to create an instance of the specified type
- Ensure that the JSON object does not contain any unexpected types
- Ensure that the JSON object is properly formatted
- Ensure that the Java class has a suitable constructor

**Section 4: Conclusion**

JsonMappingException is an exception that is thrown when Jackson is unable to find a suitable constructor for a given type. To resolve this issue, it is important to ensure that the JSON object contains all the necessary fields to create an instance of the specified type, does not contain any unexpected types, is properly formatted, and that the Java class has a suitable constructor.
