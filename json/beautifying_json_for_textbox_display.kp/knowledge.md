This can be done by adding indentation, line-breaks, and color-coding the different types of data. There are many different JSON formatters available, both online and as desktop applications. 

# Section 2: Manual Formatting

Another way to beautify JSON for display in a TextBox is to manually format it. This involves adding indentation, line-breaks, and color-coding the different types of data. This can be done by hand, or by using a text editor that has syntax highlighting for JSON files. This is a more time-consuming process, but it can be useful if the JSON data is not too complex.

# Section 3: Using a Library

Another way to beautify JSON for display in a TextBox is to use a library. Libraries are collections of code that provide specific functions or features. There are many libraries available that can be used to format JSON data. These libraries can be used to add indentation, line-breaks, and color-coding the different types of data.

# Section 4: Using a Visualizer

Finally, another way to beautify JSON for display in a TextBox is to use a visualizer. A visualizer is a program that takes in a JSON string and displays it in a graphical format. This can be useful for quickly understanding the structure of the data, as well as for debugging purposes. There are many different visualizers available, both online and as desktop applications.
