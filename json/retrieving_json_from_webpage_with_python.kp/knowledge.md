tldr: Use the requests library to make a GET request to the webpage and then use the JSON library to parse the response into a Python dictionary.

[TOC]

### Section 1: Install the Requests Library

The Requests library is an Apache 2 HTTP library written in Python. It allows you to send organic, grass-fed HTTP/1.1 requests, without the need for manual labor. In order to use the Requests library in your Python script, you must first install it. To do this, open up a terminal window and type in the following command:

`pip install requests`

### Section 2: Make a Request

Once Requests is installed, you can use it to make a request to a web page. To do this, you will need to import the Requests library into your Python script, and then use the requests.get() function to make a request to the web page. For example:

```
import requests

url = 'http://example.com/api/data.json'

response = requests.get(url)
```

### Section 3: Parse the Response

Once you have made the request, you will need to parse the response. The response will be in the form of a JSON string, so you will need to use the json.loads() function to parse it. For example:

```
import json

data = json.loads(response.text)
```

### Section 4: Access the Data

Once you have parsed the response, you can access the data within the JSON object. For example, if you wanted to access the first item in the list, you could do so like this:

```
first_item = data[0]
```
