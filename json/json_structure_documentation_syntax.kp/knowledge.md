# Section 1: Overview

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is a text-based, human-readable format for representing simple data structures and associative arrays (called objects).

# Section 2: Syntax

JSON documents are organized into key-value pairs and are enclosed in curly brackets. Keys are always strings, and values can be a variety of data types, including strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

# Section 3: Documentation

When documenting JSON structure, it is important to include the names of the keys and the data types of the values. This helps to ensure that the structure of the data is understood and that the data can be properly accessed and manipulated.

# Section 4: Example

For example, consider the following JSON object:

```
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 34,
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main Street",
    "city": "New York",
    "state": "NY"
  }
}
```

In this case, the keys are "name", "age", and "address", and the values are strings, a number, and an object, respectively.
