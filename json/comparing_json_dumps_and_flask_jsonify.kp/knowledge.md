### json.dumps

`json.dumps` is a method from the Python `json` module that serializes a Python object into a JSON string. It takes in an object, such as a dictionary, list, or string, and returns a JSON-formatted string.

### flask.jsonify

`flask.jsonify` is a function from the Flask web framework that serializes a Python object into a JSON response. It takes in an object, such as a dictionary, list, or string, and returns a JSON response object that can be sent back to the client.

### Differences

The main difference between `json.dumps` and `flask.jsonify` is that `json.dumps` returns a JSON-formatted string, while `flask.jsonify` returns a response object that can be sent back to the client. `flask.jsonify` is specifically designed to work with the Flask framework, while `json.dumps` can be used in any Python application.
