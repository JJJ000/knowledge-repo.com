1. Creating the JSON Object
  - To create the JSON object, you need to use the `JSON.stringify()` method.
  - This method takes an object and converts it into a string.
  - The resulting string can then be used to create a new JSON object.

2. Adding Properties to the JSON Object
  - To add properties to the JSON object, you need to use the `JSON.parse()` method.
  - This method takes a string and converts it into an object.
  - You can then add properties to the object using the `.set()` method.

3. Retrieving Properties from the JSON Object
  - To retrieve properties from the JSON object, you need to use the `JSON.parse()` method.
  - This method takes a string and converts it into an object.
  - You can then access the properties of the object using the `.get()` method.

4. Modifying Properties of the JSON Object
  - To modify properties of the JSON object, you need to use the `JSON.parse()` method.
  - This method takes a string and converts it into an object.
  - You can then modify the properties of the object using the `.set()` method.
