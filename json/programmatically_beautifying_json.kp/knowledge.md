[TOC]

**Section 1: Using JSON.stringify()**

The easiest way to beautify JSON programmatically is to use the `JSON.stringify()` method. This method takes a JavaScript object and converts it into a JSON string. The `JSON.stringify()` method also takes an optional second argument that allows you to specify formatting options. This argument can be used to add indentation and line breaks to the JSON string.

**Section 2: Using a JSON Formatter**

Another way to programmatically beautify JSON is to use a JSON formatter. There are several online JSON formatters available, such as jsonformatter.org and jsonviewer.stack.hu. These tools allow you to paste in a JSON string and get a nicely formatted version back.

**Section 3: Using a Library**

Finally, you can use a library such as jsonlint or json-beautifier to beautify JSON programmatically. These libraries provide methods that can be used to format a JSON string.

**Section 4: Using a Text Editor**

Many text editors, such as Sublime Text, Atom, and Visual Studio Code, include support for automatically formatting JSON. This can be done by selecting the JSON text and pressing a key combination (usually Ctrl + Alt + F) to format it.
