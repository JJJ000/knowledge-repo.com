# Section 1: Create a JSON Object

In order to read a JSON in the script tag from JavaScript, you must first create a JSON object. This can be done by using the `JSON.parse()` method. This method takes a JSON string and converts it into a JavaScript object.

# Section 2: Retrieve the JSON String

Once you have created the JSON object, you can then retrieve the JSON string by accessing the `innerHTML` property of the `<script>` tag. This will return the string of the JSON object.

# Section 3: Parse the JSON String

Now that you have the JSON string, you can parse it using the `JSON.parse()` method. This will return the JavaScript object with all the data from the JSON string.

# Section 4: Access the Data

Finally, you can access the data from the JavaScript object by using the `.` operator. This will allow you to access specific properties of the object and retrieve the data you need.
