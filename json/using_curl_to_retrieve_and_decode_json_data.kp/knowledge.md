### Section 1: Setting Up cURL

cURL is a command line tool used to transfer data to and from a server. To use cURL, it must first be installed on the computer. Once installed, the command line can be used to make a cURL request to the server.

### Section 2: Making the Request

Once cURL is installed, the following command can be used to make a request for JSON data from a server: 

`curl -X GET -H "Accept: application/json" <url>`

Replace <url> with the URL of the server containing the JSON data.

### Section 3: Decoding the JSON Data

Once the request is made, the JSON data will be returned. To decode the JSON data, a JSON parser can be used. The parser will convert the JSON data into a format that can be used by the application.

### Section 4: Using the Data

Once the JSON data has been decoded, it can be used by the application. The data can be stored in a database, used to generate HTML, or used for any other purpose that requires data.
