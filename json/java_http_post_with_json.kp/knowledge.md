# Section 1: Setting up the Request

The first step in making a POST request with JSON in Java is to set up the request. This can be done by creating a URL object and passing it to the URLConnection class. The URLConnection class can be used to set the request method to POST and set the content type to application/json.

# Section 2: Constructing the JSON

The next step is to construct the JSON data that will be sent in the POST request. This can be done by creating a JSONObject and adding the necessary key-value pairs.

# Section 3: Writing the Request

Once the JSON data is constructed, it can be written to the request body using the OutputStream of the URLConnection. The data can be written using the write() method of the OutputStream.

# Section 4: Sending the Request

The final step is to send the request. This can be done by calling the connect() method of the URLConnection. The response from the server can then be read using the InputStream of the URLConnection.
