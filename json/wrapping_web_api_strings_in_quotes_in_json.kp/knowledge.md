**Yes**

**Reasoning**

When sending data between a server and web application, the data must be in a format that both can understand. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a widely used data format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. Since JSON is a text-based format, it is often wrapped in quotes to indicate the beginning and end of a string of text. This ensures that the data is properly parsed and interpreted by the receiving application.

**Benefits**

Wrapping strings in quotes when sending them through a Web API has several benefits. First, it allows the receiving application to properly identify and interpret the data. Second, it ensures that the data is properly formatted and can be easily parsed. Finally, it allows for data to be stored in a consistent format, which makes it easier to work with and debug.

**Drawbacks**

The main drawback of wrapping strings in quotes when sending them through a Web API is that it can increase the size of the data being sent. This can lead to slower response times, which can have a negative impact on the user experience. Additionally, if the data is not properly formatted, it can lead to errors or incorrect data being sent.
