### Data Structure

YAML and JSON are both data serialization languages used to store and transfer data. YAML is a human-readable data serialization language that is designed to be easy to read and write. JSON, on the other hand, is a machine-readable data serialization language that is designed for efficient data exchange between programs.

### Syntax

YAML is a whitespace-sensitive language that uses indentation to denote structure. It also uses colons and hyphens to denote key-value pairs. JSON, on the other hand, uses curly braces, brackets, and commas to denote structure.

### Data Types

YAML supports a wide range of data types, including strings, integers, floats, booleans, arrays, and objects. JSON, on the other hand, only supports a limited set of data types, such as strings, numbers, booleans, and arrays.

### Usage

YAML is often used to store configuration files, while JSON is used for data interchange in web applications. YAML is also used in applications such as Ansible, while JSON is commonly used in REST APIs.
