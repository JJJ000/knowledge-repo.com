# Boolean
Boolean values in JSON can be represented as either 0 or 1. This is the most common way to represent boolean values in JSON.

# Int
Integer values in JSON can also be represented as either 0 or 1. This is a less common way to represent boolean values in JSON, and is not recommended unless absolutely necessary.
