## Section 1: Definition

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is a text-based format that is used to store and transport data between a server and a client application, such as a web browser.

## Section 2: Object

JSON objects are collections of name/value pairs. They are enclosed in curly braces and are separated by commas. A name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value.

## Section 3: Array

JSON arrays are ordered collections of values. They are enclosed in square brackets and are separated by commas. The values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, true, false, or null.

## Section 4: Determining if Json Results is Object or Array

The way to determine if a JSON result is an object or an array is to examine the syntax of the JSON string. If the string is enclosed in curly braces, it is an object. If the string is enclosed in square brackets, it is an array.
