**Contents**

[TOC]

**Section 1: Create a Custom Deserializer**

Create a custom deserializer class that implements the JsonDeserializer interface. This class will be responsible for transforming a JSON object into a Java object. The class must override the deserialize() method, which takes in a JsonElement object and a Type object. The JsonElement object contains the JSON object that needs to be deserialized, while the Type object contains the type of Java object the JSON needs to be deserialized into.

**Section 2: Deserialize the JSON Object**

In the deserialize() method, first extract the JSON object from the JsonElement object using the getAsJsonObject() method. Then, iterate through the JSON object and extract the values for each field. These values can then be used to create a new Java object of the specified type.

**Section 3: Return the Deserialized Object**

Once the Java object has been created, it can be returned from the deserialize() method. This will allow the Gson library to use the custom deserializer to deserialize the JSON object into the specified Java object.

**Section 4: Register the Custom Deserializer**

In order for the custom deserializer to be used, it must be registered with the Gson library. This can be done by creating a GsonBuilder object and then calling the registerTypeAdapter() method on the builder, passing in the type of the Java object and the custom deserializer. The Gson object can then be created from the builder and used to deserialize the JSON object into the specified Java object.
