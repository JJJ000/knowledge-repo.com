## Yes

Fiddler's Request Builder allows you to make JSON requests. It provides an easy-to-use interface for building and sending HTTP requests. You can build requests using the Request Builder's graphical interface, or you can write your own JSON code directly.

## Using the Graphical Interface

You can use the graphical interface to build a request by entering the URL, headers, and request body. You can also select the request type (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) and the Content-Type (JSON, XML, etc.). Once you've entered all the necessary information, you can click the "Send" button to send the request.

## Writing JSON Code

If you want to write your own JSON code, you can use the "Raw" tab in the Request Builder. This tab allows you to write your own JSON code and send it with the request.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, it is possible to make JSON requests using Fiddler's Request Builder. You can use the graphical interface to build a request, or you can write your own JSON code directly.
