# Section 1 - Overview
Cannot unmarshal a string into a Go value of type int64 in JSON is an issue that arises when attempting to convert a JSON string into a Go type. This issue can occur when the JSON string contains a value that is not compatible with the type specified in the Go program.

# Section 2 - Reasons
This issue can occur for several reasons. The most common reason is that the JSON string contains a value that is not a valid integer. For example, if the JSON string contains a decimal value, the Go program will not be able to convert it into an int64. Additionally, the JSON string may contain a value that is too large or too small to be represented as an int64.

# Section 3 - Solutions
The first step in resolving this issue is to ensure that the JSON string contains only valid integer values. If the JSON string contains any non-integer values, they should be removed or replaced with an appropriate integer value. Additionally, the Go program should be modified to use a larger integer type if the JSON string contains values that are too large or too small to be represented as an int64.

# Section 4 - Conclusion
Cannot unmarshal a string into a Go value of type int64 in JSON is an issue that can occur when attempting to convert a JSON string into a Go type. This issue can occur for several reasons, such as the JSON string containing a value that is not a valid integer or a value that is too large or too small to be represented as an int64. To resolve this issue, it is important to ensure that the JSON string contains only valid integer values and to modify the Go program to use a larger integer type if necessary.
