tldr: The order of JSON objects using Jackson`s ObjectMapper is determined by the order in which the fields are added to the Java object.

## 1. Configuring ObjectMapper

To use Jackson's ObjectMapper, you must first configure it. This can be done by using the ObjectMapper.configure() method. This method takes a set of configuration options as parameters and sets them accordingly. For example, you can set the default date format, the default view, the default indentation, and the default serialization features.

## 2. Writing JSON Objects

Once the ObjectMapper is configured, you can use it to write JSON objects. This can be done by using the ObjectMapper.writeValue() method. This method takes a Java object as a parameter and serializes it into a JSON string.

## 3. Reading JSON Objects

The ObjectMapper can also be used to read JSON objects. This can be done by using the ObjectMapper.readValue() method. This method takes a JSON string as a parameter and deserializes it into a Java object.

## 4. Customizing ObjectMapper

The ObjectMapper can be further customized by using the ObjectMapper.setProperty() method. This method takes a set of property names and values and sets them accordingly. This can be used to customize the behavior of the ObjectMapper, such as setting custom serializers and deserializers.
