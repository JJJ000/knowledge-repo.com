# Section 1: Import JSON Libraries

In order to convert a jsonString to a JSONObject, you must first import the necessary libraries.

The two most popular libraries for parsing and manipulating JSON in Java are Jackson and Gson.

For example, to import Jackson, you would add the following line to your code:

`import com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.ObjectMapper;`

# Section 2: Create ObjectMapper

Once you have imported the necessary libraries, you must create an ObjectMapper.

This is an instance of the Jackson library that allows you to parse and manipulate JSON.

For example, to create an ObjectMapper in Jackson, you would use the following code:

`ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper();`

# Section 3: Read JSON String

Once you have created an ObjectMapper, you can then use it to read the JSON string.

This will parse the JSON string and create a JSONObject from it.

For example, to read a JSON string in Jackson, you would use the following code:

`JSONObject jsonObject = objectMapper.readValue(jsonString, JSONObject.class);`

# Section 4: Manipulate JSONObject

Once you have read the JSON string and created a JSONObject, you can then manipulate it as needed.

For example, to get a value from a JSONObject in Jackson, you would use the following code:

`String value = jsonObject.getString("key");`
