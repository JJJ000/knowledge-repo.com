[TOC]

# Section 1: Set Up Gson Library

In order to parse a JSON file with Gson, you first need to set up the Gson library in your project. To do this, you need to add the Gson dependency to your project's build.gradle file. 

```
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.5'
}
```

# Section 2: Create a Gson Object

Once you have the Gson library set up in your project, you can create a Gson object to parse the JSON file. This is done by calling the Gson constructor.

```
Gson gson = new Gson();
```

# Section 3: Read the JSON File

Once you have created a Gson object, you can read the JSON file by using the Gson object's `fromJson()` method. This method takes two parameters: a `Reader` object that reads the JSON file, and the type of the object that will be returned.

```
Reader reader = new FileReader("path/to/file.json");
MyObject myObject = gson.fromJson(reader, MyObject.class);
```

# Section 4: Parse the JSON File

Once you have read the JSON file, you can parse it by using the Gson object's `fromJson()` method. This method takes two parameters: a `JsonElement` object that represents the JSON file, and the type of the object that will be returned.

```
JsonElement jsonElement = gson.fromJson(reader, JsonElement.class);
MyObject myObject = gson.fromJson(jsonElement, MyObject.class);
```
