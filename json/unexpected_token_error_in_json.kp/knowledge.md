## What is JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is a text-based, human-readable format for representing simple data structures and objects. It is used by web applications to transfer data between a server and a client.

## What is an Unexpected Token Error
An Unexpected Token error is a syntax error that occurs when the parser encounters an unexpected character in the code. This can happen when the code is not properly formatted or when the code contains invalid characters.

## Causes of the Error
The most common cause of this error is when the JSON is not properly formatted. This can happen when the code is manually written or when the code is generated by a program. The error can also occur when the code contains invalid characters, such as a comma instead of a colon.

## How to Fix the Error
The best way to fix this error is to make sure that the JSON is properly formatted and that all characters are valid. If the JSON is generated by a program, it is important to make sure that the program is properly configured to generate valid JSON. Additionally, if the code is manually written, it is important to double-check that all of the syntax is correct.
