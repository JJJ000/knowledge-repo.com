**Section 1: What is Django Object?**

Django Object is a type of object-oriented programming language used in web development. It is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.

**Section 2: What is JSON?**

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is a text-based, human-readable format for representing simple data structures and associative arrays (called objects). The JSON format is often used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection.

**Section 3: Why Django Object is Not JSON Serializable?**

Django Object is not JSON serializable because the two languages have different data structures and syntax. Django objects are based on Python, which uses a different syntax and data structure than JSON. Additionally, Django objects contain more data than is typically found in JSON objects, such as methods and properties. Therefore, Django objects cannot be directly converted to JSON. 

**Section 4: How to Convert Django Objects to JSON?**

In order to convert Django objects to JSON, you must first serialize the objects into a Python dictionary. This can be done using the built-in json module. Once the objects have been serialized into a dictionary, they can then be encoded into JSON using the json.dumps() method. This will allow the objects to be converted into a JSON-formatted string.
