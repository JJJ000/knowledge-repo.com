tldr: Deserialize a JObject to a .NET object by using the JObject.ToObject<T>() method.

**Contents**

[TOC]

1. Create the .NET Object 

Create the .NET object that you want to deserialize the JObject into. This should include all the properties and data types that are present in the JObject. 

2. Use JsonConvert.DeserializeObject 

Use the JsonConvert.DeserializeObject method to deserialize the JObject into the .NET object created in the previous step. This method will take in the JObject and the type of the .NET object to be deserialized. 

3. Handle Exceptions 

Use a try-catch block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the deserialization process. This will ensure that any errors are handled gracefully and that the program does not crash. 

4. Return the Deserialized Object 

Return the deserialized object from the method that is performing the deserialization. This will allow the object to be used in other parts of the program.
