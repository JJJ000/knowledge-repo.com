tldr: Traverse all the Nodes of a JSON Object Tree with JavaScript by using the for loop to iterate over the object`s keys and recursively call the same function on the object`s values.

# Section 1: Retrieve the JSON Object

To traverse a JSON object tree with JavaScript, we first need to retrieve the JSON object. This can be done by using the `JSON.parse()` method, which takes a JSON string and parses it into a JavaScript object.

# Section 2: Access the Nodes

Once we have the JSON object, we can access its nodes by using the dot (`.`) or bracket (`[]`) notation. The dot notation is used to access the properties of an object, while the bracket notation is used to access the elements of an array.

# Section 3: Iterate Through the Nodes

To iterate through the nodes of the JSON object tree, we can use the `for...in` loop. This loop will iterate through each key in the object and allow us to access its value. We can also use the `for...of` loop to iterate through the elements of an array.

# Section 4: Traverse the Tree

Finally, we can traverse the JSON object tree by recursively calling the `JSON.parse()` method on each node. This will allow us to access the nodes of the tree and iterate through them as needed.
