tldr: Python`s built-in libraries, such as urllib and json, make it easy to make HTTP requests and parse JSON data.

# Section 1: Making an HTTP Request

Making an HTTP request in Python is done through the `requests` module. This module allows you to make requests to a web server and get a response back. The response will usually be in the form of a JSON object.

To make an HTTP request, you will need to import the `requests` module and then use the `get` or `post` methods. For example:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get("http://example.com/api/data")
```

This will make a `GET` request to the URL `http://example.com/api/data`, and the response will be stored in the `response` variable.

# Section 2: Parsing the Response

Once you have made the request, you will need to parse the response. This can be done using the `json` module. The `json` module provides functions for encoding and decoding JSON data.

To parse the response, you will need to import the `json` module and then use the `loads` method. For example:

```python
import json

data = json.loads(response.text)
```

This will parse the response text into a Python dictionary, which can then be used to access the data.

# Section 3: Accessing the Data

Once the response has been parsed into a Python dictionary, you can access the data using the keys in the dictionary. For example:

```python
name = data["name"]
age = data["age"]
```

This will access the `name` and `age` keys in the dictionary and store the values in the `name` and `age` variables.

# Section 4: Error Handling

When making an HTTP request, it is important to handle any errors that may occur. The `requests` module provides a `raise_for_status` method, which will raise an exception if the response code is not in the 200 range. For example:

```python
response.raise_for_status()
```

This will raise an exception if the response code is not in the 200 range, allowing you to handle any errors that may occur.
