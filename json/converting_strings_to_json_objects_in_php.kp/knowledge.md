## Section 1: Install JSON Extension

The first step to converting a string to a JSON object in PHP is to install the JSON extension. This extension provides functions for encoding, decoding, and manipulating JSON data. To install the JSON extension, open the terminal and run the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install php7.0-json
```

## Section 2: Decode the String

Once the JSON extension has been installed, you can use the `json_decode()` function to convert the string into a JSON object. This function takes two parameters: the string to be decoded, and an optional boolean value which determines whether or not to return an associative array.

For example, to decode a string and return an associative array, you can use the following code:

```php
$string = '{"name":"John","age":30}';
$json_object = json_decode($string, true);
```

## Section 3: Access the Object

Once the string has been decoded, you can access the object using the appropriate keys. For example, to access the name from the JSON object, you can use the following code:

```php
echo $json_object['name']; // Outputs "John"
```

## Section 4: Encode the Object

Finally, if you want to convert the JSON object back into a string, you can use the `json_encode()` function. This function takes a single parameter: the JSON object to be encoded.

For example, to encode a JSON object, you can use the following code:

```php
$string = json_encode($json_object);
```
