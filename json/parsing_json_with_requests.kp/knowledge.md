## Step 1: Install the Requests Library

The first step in parsing a JSON response from the requests library is to install the library. This can be done using the pip command:

```
pip install requests
```

## Step 2: Make the Request

Once the requests library is installed, you can make the request using the `requests.get()` method. This method takes a URL as an argument and returns a response object.

## Step 3: Convert the Response to JSON

The response object contains the JSON data, but it is not in a usable format. To convert the response to JSON, use the `.json()` method on the response object. This will return a Python dictionary containing the JSON data.

## Step 4: Parse the JSON Data

Now that the JSON data is in a usable format, you can parse it using the Python dictionary methods. For example, you can use `dictionary['key']` to access the value associated with a specific key.
