### Defining the Problem

The problem is to find the maximum value of an attribute in an array of objects in JSON.

### Extracting the Data

The first step is to extract the data from the JSON array. This can be done by looping through the array and extracting the desired attribute from each object. 

### Comparing the Values

The next step is to compare the values of the extracted attribute and determine which one is the maximum. This can be done by looping through the array and comparing the values of each object. 

### Finding the Maximum Value

The final step is to find the maximum value. This can be done by looping through the array and keeping track of the maximum value found so far. Once the loop is complete, the maximum value will be the value of the attribute with the highest value.
