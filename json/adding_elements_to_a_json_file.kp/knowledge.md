**Section 1: Find the JSON File**

The first step is to find the JSON file that you want to add an element to. This can be done by either navigating to the file's location on your computer, or by using a search engine to locate the file.

**Section 2: Open the JSON File**

Once you have located the JSON file, you will need to open it. This can be done by using a text editor or a JSON editor. If you are using a text editor, you will need to ensure that the file is in a format that can be read by the text editor.

**Section 3: Add the Element**

Once the file is open, you can add the element that you want to add. This can be done by typing in the element and its associated values into the file.

**Section 4: Save the File**

Once you have added the element, you will need to save the file. This can be done by clicking the 'Save' button, or by pressing the 'Ctrl+S' key combination. Once the file has been saved, the element will be added to the JSON file.
