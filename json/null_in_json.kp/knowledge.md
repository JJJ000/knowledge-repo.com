### Null Value
In JSON, the null value is represented by the keyword `null`.

### Example

{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": null
}
```

### Usage
Null values are used to represent the absence of a value or a null pointer in programming.

### Advantages
Using `null` values in JSON helps reduce the size of the data and makes it easier to parse.
