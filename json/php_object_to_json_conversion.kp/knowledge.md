### Serializing PHP Objects

Serializing a PHP object involves transforming it into a storable representation of its current state. This can be done using the `serialize()` function, which will return a string representation of the object's properties and values.

### Deserializing PHP Objects

Deserializing a PHP object involves transforming the storable representation of its current state back into a PHP object. This can be done using the `unserialize()` function, which will take a string representation of the object's properties and values and convert it back into a PHP object.

### Serializing PHP Objects to JSON

Serializing a PHP object to JSON involves transforming it into a JSON string representation of its current state. This can be done using the `json_encode()` function, which will return a JSON string representation of the object's properties and values.

### Deserializing JSON to PHP Objects

Deserializing a JSON string to a PHP object involves transforming the JSON string representation of its current state back into a PHP object. This can be done using the `json_decode()` function, which will take a JSON string representation of the object's properties and values and convert it back into a PHP object.
