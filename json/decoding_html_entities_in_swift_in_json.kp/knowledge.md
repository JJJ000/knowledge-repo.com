This method will allow you to provide custom logic to decode HTML entities.

# Section 2: Using Regular Expressions

This class can be used to parse the JSON string and extract the HTML entities. The extracted entities can then be replaced with their corresponding characters.

# Section 4: Using SwiftSoup
