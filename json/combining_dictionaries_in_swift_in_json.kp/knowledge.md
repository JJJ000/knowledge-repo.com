### Section 1: Merging Two Dictionaries

In Swift, two Dictionary instances can be combined using the `merge()` function. This function takes two dictionaries as parameters and returns a single, merged dictionary.

### Section 2: Syntax

The syntax for the `merge()` function is as follows: 

```swift
let mergedDict = dict1.merge(dict2)
```

Where `dict1` and `dict2` are the two dictionaries to be merged.

### Section 3: Example

For example, if we have two dictionaries:

```swift
let dict1 = ["key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"]
let dict2 = ["key3": "value3", "key4": "value4"]
```

We can merge them using the `merge()` function:

```swift
let mergedDict = dict1.merge(dict2)
```

The resulting merged dictionary will contain all the keys and values from both `dict1` and `dict2`:

```swift
let mergedDict = ["key1": "value1", "key2": "value2", "key3": "value3", "key4": "value4"]
```

### Section 4: Merging with Duplicate Keys

If the two dictionaries contain duplicate keys, the value from the second dictionary will overwrite the value from the first dictionary. For example, if `dict1` and `dict2` contain the same key:

```swift
let dict1 = ["key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"]
let dict2 = ["key2": "value3", "key4": "value4"]
```

The resulting merged dictionary will contain the value from `dict2` for the duplicate key:

```swift
let mergedDict = ["key1": "value1", "key2": "value3", "key4": "value4"]
```
