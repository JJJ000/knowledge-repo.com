**Contents**

[TOC]

# Section 1: Overview
When deserializing an instance of an object from a JSON string, the JSON string must contain the correct type of token for the object. If the JSON string contains a START_ARRAY token instead of the expected token, deserialization will fail.

# Section 2: Causes
The most common cause of this error is when the JSON string contains an array instead of an object. This can happen if the JSON string is malformed or if the object is being serialized incorrectly.

# Section 3: Solutions
The first step to resolving this issue is to ensure that the JSON string is properly formatted and contains the correct type of token for the object. If the JSON string is properly formatted but still contains a START_ARRAY token, the object may need to be serialized differently.

# Section 4: Conclusion
Deserializing an instance of an object from a JSON string requires that the JSON string contains the correct type of token for the object. If the JSON string contains a START_ARRAY token instead of the expected token, deserialization will fail. To resolve this issue, the JSON string must be properly formatted and the object may need to be serialized differently.
