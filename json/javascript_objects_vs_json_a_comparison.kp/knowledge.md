## Javascript Object
A JavaScript object is an object that is created using the object literal syntax, which is a set of curly brackets surrounding a set of key-value pairs.

## JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is a text-based, human-readable format for representing simple data structures and associative arrays (called objects).

## Difference
The main difference between a JavaScript object and JSON is that a JavaScript object is an actual object in the programming language, while JSON is a string representation of an object. JSON is used for data storage and communication between a server and a client, while a JavaScript object is used to represent data within the programming language.
