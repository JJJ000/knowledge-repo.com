**Contents**

[TOC]

Yes, .NET 4 has a built-in JSON serializer/deserializer in Json.

## System.Text.Json

System.Text.Json is a built-in library in .NET 4 that provides a high-performance, low-allocating, and standards-compliant way to work with JSON. It supports serializing and deserializing objects, arrays, and primitive types.

## Benefits

System.Text.Json has several benefits compared to other JSON serializers. It is fast, efficient, and lightweight, and offers a more natural way to work with JSON data. Additionally, it is standards compliant, which means that it supports the latest JSON specifications.

## Usage

Using System.Text.Json is straightforward. To serialize an object, simply call the Serialize() method, passing in the object to be serialized. To deserialize an object, call the Deserialize() method, passing in the JSON string to be deserialized.
