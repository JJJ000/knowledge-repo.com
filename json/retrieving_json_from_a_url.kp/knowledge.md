[TOC]

### Section 1: Load the URL

To get a JSON string from a URL, first you need to load the URL. This can be done using the `fetch` API, which is part of the JavaScript language.

### Section 2: Parse the Response

Once the URL has been loaded, you need to parse the response. This can be done using the `JSON.parse()` method, which takes a string and converts it into a JavaScript object.

### Section 3: Access the Data

Once the response has been parsed, you can access the data by using the appropriate keys. For example, if the JSON string contains an array, you can access each element of the array using the `array[index]` syntax.

### Section 4: Return the Data

Finally, you can return the data by using the `JSON.stringify()` method. This takes a JavaScript object and converts it into a JSON string. This can then be returned to the caller.
