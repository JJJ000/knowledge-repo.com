#### Section 1: Encoding a Python Object

The first step in encoding a Python object in JSON is to convert the object into a Python dictionary. This can be done by calling the `dict()` function on the object. This will return a dictionary containing the object's attributes and their respective values.

#### Section 2: Serializing the Python Dictionary

The next step is to serialize the Python dictionary into a JSON string. This can be done by using the `json.dumps()` function. This will return a JSON string containing the object's attributes and their respective values.

#### Section 3: Decoding the JSON String

The final step is to decode the JSON string back into a Python object. This can be done by using the `json.loads()` function. This will return a Python object with the same attributes and values as the original Python object.

#### Section 4: Verifying the Conversion

To verify that the conversion was successful, the original Python object and the newly created Python object can be compared to ensure that they have the same attributes and values.
