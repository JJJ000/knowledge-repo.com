tldr: You can loop through a JSON object list by using a for loop to iterate over the list elements.

## Section 1: Accessing the JSON Object List

The first step in looping through a JSON object list is to access the list itself. This can be done by using the `JSON.parse()` method, which will parse a JSON string and return the corresponding object. Once the list is accessed, it can be looped through using a `for...in` loop.

## Section 2: Looping Through the List

The `for...in` loop is used to loop through the JSON object list. The syntax for this loop is as follows:

```
for (let key in list) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

Where `list` is the JSON object list being looped through and `key` is the key of the current element in the list.

## Section 3: Accessing the Values

Once the loop is set up, the values of the JSON object list can be accessed using the `list[key]` syntax. This syntax will return the value associated with the key in the current element of the list.

## Section 4: Processing the Values

Finally, the values can be processed within the loop. This can be done by using standard JavaScript functions such as `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, etc. to manipulate the values and perform the desired operations.
