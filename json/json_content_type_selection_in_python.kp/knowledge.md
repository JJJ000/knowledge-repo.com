### Application/JSON
This is the most common content type used when sending and receiving JSON data. It is the recommended content type for most JSON requests and responses.

### Text/JSON
This content type is used when sending and receiving JSON data that is not formatted as a JavaScript object.

### Text/Plain
This content type is used when sending and receiving plain text data. This is not recommended for JSON data, as it does not provide any additional metadata about the data being sent or received.

### Application/JavaScript
This content type is used when sending and receiving JSON data that is formatted as a JavaScript object. This is the recommended content type for JavaScript applications that use JSON data.
