## What is Prototype.js
Prototype.js is a JavaScript framework that provides a set of tools for building rich web applications. It provides a library of functions to help developers create dynamic and interactive web applications.

## How does Prototype.js Interact with JSON
Prototype.js has a built-in JSON parser that allows developers to parse JSON data and use it within their applications. The parser supports both the standard JSON syntax as well as the more compact Prototype.js syntax. The parser is also able to convert between the two formats, allowing developers to easily work with JSON data.

## What is JSON.stringify()
JSON.stringify() is a JavaScript function that converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string. It takes an optional second argument, which can be used to customize the stringification process.

## What is the Bizarreness with Prototype.js in JSON
When using Prototype.js with JSON, it is important to note that the Prototype.js parser does not support the full range of JSON syntax. This can lead to unexpected results when attempting to stringify an array with Prototype.js. In particular, Prototype.js does not support the use of commas to separate elements in an array. As a result, when attempting to stringify an array with Prototype.js, the resulting string will contain only the first element of the array.
