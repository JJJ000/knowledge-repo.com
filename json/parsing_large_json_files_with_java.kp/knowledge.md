tldr: The best approach to parse a huge JSON file in Java is to use a streaming JSON parser such as Jackson or Gson.

##### Stream-based Parsing
Stream-based parsing is the best approach to parse huge JSON files. This approach involves reading the JSON file character by character and parsing it as it goes. This approach is memory-efficient since it does not require the entire file to be loaded into memory at once. Additionally, it can be used to parse JSON files of any size, since it only reads and parses the data as it goes.

##### Event-driven Parsing
Event-driven parsing is another approach to parsing large JSON files. This approach involves using an event-driven parser, such as the Jackson Streaming API, to parse the JSON file. The parser reads the JSON file and emits events when it encounters certain elements. This approach is also memory-efficient since it does not require the entire file to be loaded into memory at once. Additionally, it can be used to parse JSON files of any size, since it only reads and parses the data as it goes.

##### Tree-based Parsing
Tree-based parsing is the third approach to parsing large JSON files. This approach involves using a tree-based parser, such as the Jackson Tree Model, to parse the JSON file. The parser reads the JSON file and builds a tree structure of the data. This approach is not as memory-efficient as the other two approaches since it requires the entire file to be loaded into memory at once. Additionally, it can only be used to parse JSON files of a certain size, since it requires the entire file to be loaded into memory at once.

##### Custom Parsing
Custom parsing is the fourth approach to parsing large JSON files. This approach involves writing custom code to parse the JSON file. This approach is the most time-consuming and difficult to implement, since it requires writing custom code to parse the JSON file. Additionally, it can only be used to parse JSON files of a certain size, since it requires the entire file to be loaded into memory at once.
