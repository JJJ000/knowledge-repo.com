## Section 1: Introduction
Python's urllib2 module is a powerful tool for making HTTP requests. It can be used to send and receive data in various formats, including JSON. This tutorial will explain how to use urllib2 to receive a JSON response from a URL.

## Section 2: Setting Up
Before you can use urllib2 to receive a JSON response from a URL, you will need to import the module and create a request object. To do this, use the following code:

```
import urllib2

url = "https://example.com/data.json"
req = urllib2.Request(url)
```

## Section 3: Making the Request
Once you have created the request object, you can make the request using the following code:

```
response = urllib2.urlopen(req)
```

This will return a response object containing the data from the URL.

## Section 4: Retrieving the Data
You can then retrieve the data from the response object using the following code:

```
data = response.read()
```

This will return the data in the form of a string. To convert the string into a JSON object, use the following code:

```
json_data = json.loads(data)
```

This will return a JSON object which can then be used to access the data in the response.
