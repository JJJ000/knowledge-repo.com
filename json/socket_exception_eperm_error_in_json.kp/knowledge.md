## Overview

The `java.net.SocketException: socket failed: EPERM (Operation not permitted)` error is a common issue that arises when attempting to establish a network connection. This error occurs when the system is unable to create a socket due to a lack of permissions. This error can occur when trying to establish a connection using a Java application or when using a third-party library such as JSON.

## Causes

The most common cause of this error is a lack of permissions. This can occur when the user does not have the necessary permissions to create a socket or when the application does not have the necessary permissions to access the network. Additionally, this error can be caused by a firewall blocking the connection or a network configuration issue.

## Solutions

The first step in resolving this issue is to ensure that the user has the necessary permissions to create a socket. This can be done by ensuring that the user has the proper permissions to access the network. Additionally, it is important to check the firewall settings to ensure that the connection is not being blocked. Finally, it is important to check the network configuration to ensure that the connection is properly configured.
