## Section 1: Set Up

Before beginning the process of traversing a complex dictionary of unknown depth in JSON, it's important to set up the environment. This includes:

1. Installing any necessary packages/libraries
2. Creating a function to traverse the dictionary
3. Setting up any variables to keep track of the data

## Section 2: Traversal

Once the environment is set up, the actual traversal of the dictionary can begin. This process involves:

1. Iterating over the dictionary
2. Checking for any nested dictionaries
3. If nested dictionaries are found, recursively calling the same traversal function
4. Storing the data in the variables set up in the first step

## Section 3: Output

Once the traversal is complete, the data stored in the variables can be outputted. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as:

1. Printing the data to the console
2. Saving the data to a file
3. Exporting the data to a database

## Section 4: Clean Up

Finally, it's important to clean up after the traversal. This includes:

1. Closing any open files
2. Releasing any allocated memory
3. Resetting any variables used during the process
