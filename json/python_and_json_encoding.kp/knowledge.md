## Section 1: Overview

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is a language-independent data format that is used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language and is easy for humans to read and write.

## Section 2: Syntax

JSON has a very simple syntax which consists of objects, arrays, values, and strings. Objects are collections of key-value pairs, with the key being a string and the value being any type of data. Arrays are ordered lists of elements. Values can be strings, numbers, booleans, or null. Strings are a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes.

## Section 3: Encoding

In JSON, data is encoded as a string of text. The encoding process involves taking the data and converting it into a format that can be understood by the computer. This is done by using specific rules and syntax that define how the data should be structured.

## Section 4: Decoding

Decoding is the process of converting a JSON string back into its original form. This is done by using the same syntax and rules used in encoding. The decoded data can then be used in applications or programs.
