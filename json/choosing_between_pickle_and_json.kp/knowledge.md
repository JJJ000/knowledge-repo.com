## Pickle
Pickle is a Python-specific format for serializing and deserializing data. It is a binary format, meaning that it is not human-readable. It is useful for storing objects and data structures in a single file, and can be used to serialize and deserialize almost any Python object.

## JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based, human-readable format for representing simple data structures and objects. It is language-independent, meaning that it can be used with many different programming languages. Unlike Pickle, JSON is not specific to Python, and is often used to exchange data between different systems.
