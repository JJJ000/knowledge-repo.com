**Section 1: What is JSON?**

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is a text-based, human-readable format for representing structured data based on JavaScript object syntax.

**Section 2: What is the Issue?**

In Internet Explorer 8, JSON objects are not supported, which means that any code using JSON objects will not work.

**Section 3: What is the Solution?**

The solution is to use a polyfill library such as json2.js or es5-shim.js to add support for JSON objects in Internet Explorer 8.

**Section 4: How to Implement the Solution?**

In order to implement the solution, the polyfill library needs to be included in the HTML page. This can be done by adding a script tag pointing to the library, or by including the library in the pageâ€™s JavaScript file. Once the library is included, the JSON object will be supported in Internet Explorer 8.
