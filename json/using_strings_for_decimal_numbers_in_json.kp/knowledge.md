#### Advantages

String representation of a decimal number in JSON provides the ability to represent a number with arbitrary precision. This allows the data to be stored more accurately, as the exact value of the number is preserved.

#### Disadvantages

String representation of a decimal number in JSON can be more difficult to parse, as the data must be converted back into a number before it can be used. Additionally, the size of the data can be larger, as the string representation is typically longer than the numeric representation.
