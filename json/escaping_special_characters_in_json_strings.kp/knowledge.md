1. Using Escape Characters
--------------------------------
A JSON string can be escaped using a backslash (“\”) character before the character to be escaped. For example, to escape a double quote (“) within a string, you would use the following syntax:

```
"This is an example of \"escaping\" a double quote."
```

2. Using Unicode Characters
--------------------------------
JSON strings can also be escaped using Unicode characters. For example, to escape a double quote (“) within a string, you would use the following syntax:

```
"This is an example of \u0022escaping\u0022 a double quote."
```

3. Using HTML Character Entities
--------------------------------
JSON strings can also be escaped using HTML character entities. For example, to escape a double quote (“) within a string, you would use the following syntax:

```
"This is an example of &quot;escaping&quot; a double quote."
```

4. Using String Replacement
--------------------------------
JSON strings can also be escaped using string replacement. For example, to escape a double quote (“) within a string, you would use the following syntax:

```
"This is an example of \"escaping\" a double quote.".replace("\"", "\\\"")
```
