# Introduction
Yesod is a Haskell web framework for creating modern web applications. It is built on the foundations of the Haskell programming language, providing a type-safe, high-performance, and robust web framework. Yesod is designed to be fast, secure, and easy to use, making it an ideal choice for developing web applications.

# Handling Exceptions in Yesod
Yesod provides a number of tools for dealing with exceptions. It provides a mechanism for catching and handling errors, as well as providing a way to return JSON responses in the event of an exception.

# JSON Responses
When an exception is thrown in Yesod, the framework will automatically convert it into a JSON response. This response will contain a status code, an error message, and any additional information that is relevant to the exception. The JSON response can then be used to provide feedback to the user or to log the error.

# Conclusion
Yesod provides a robust and secure way to handle exceptions in web applications. It provides a mechanism for catching and handling errors, as well as providing a way to return JSON responses in the event of an exception. This makes it easy to provide feedback to the user or to log the error, allowing developers to quickly and easily debug their applications.
