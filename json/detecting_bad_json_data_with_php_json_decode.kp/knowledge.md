[TOC]

**Section 1: Detecting Syntax Errors**

When PHP's `json_decode()` function encounters invalid JSON data, it will return `NULL` and generate an error message. This error message can be used to detect syntax errors in the JSON data.

**Section 2: Detecting Semantic Errors**

Semantic errors are more difficult to detect as the syntax of the JSON data is valid, but the data itself is not meaningful. To detect these errors, it is necessary to manually inspect the JSON data.

**Section 3: Debugging**

Debugging JSON data can be done using a JSON linter. This linter will detect errors such as missing commas or brackets, extra characters, and invalid characters.

**Section 4: Testing**

Once the JSON data has been debugged and validated, it is important to test it to ensure it is valid and produces the expected results. This can be done by running the `json_decode()` function with the JSON data and inspecting the output.
