## Using a JSON Parser

The most straightforward way to parse "relaxed" JSON without eval is to use a JSON parser. JSON parsers are available in many languages, including JavaScript, Python, Java, and C#. These parsers are designed to parse valid JSON strings and can be used to parse "relaxed" JSON strings as well.

## Using Regular Expressions

Another way to parse "relaxed" JSON without eval is to use regular expressions. Regular expressions are powerful tools for matching patterns in text, and can be used to parse "relaxed" JSON strings. Regular expressions can be used to parse both valid and "relaxed" JSON strings, but they can be difficult to write and maintain.

## Using a Custom Parser

If neither of the above methods are feasible, it is possible to write a custom parser for "relaxed" JSON without eval. A custom parser can be written in any language and can be tailored to the specific needs of the application. Writing a custom parser can be time-consuming and requires a deep understanding of the data format, but can be a powerful way to parse "relaxed" JSON without eval.

## Using a Third-Party Library

Finally, there are several third-party libraries available that can be used to parse "relaxed" JSON without eval. These libraries are typically written in JavaScript and can be used to parse both valid and "relaxed" JSON strings. They are typically easy to use and can save time and effort when parsing "relaxed" JSON strings.
