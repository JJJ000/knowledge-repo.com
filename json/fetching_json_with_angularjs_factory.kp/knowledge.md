# Section 1: Overview
AngularJS is a popular JavaScript framework used for building single-page web applications. It provides a powerful framework for creating dynamic web applications and enables developers to quickly create and maintain complex web applications. One of the most useful features of AngularJS is the ability to use factories to make HTTP requests to retrieve data from external sources. This is especially useful when retrieving data from a JSON file.

# Section 2: Setting up the Factory
In order to use the factory to make an HTTP request to retrieve a JSON file, the first step is to set up the factory. This involves creating a new factory and then injecting the $http service into the factory. The $http service is used to make the actual HTTP request.

# Section 3: Making the Request
Once the factory has been set up, the next step is to make the actual HTTP request. This is done by using the $http.get() method. This method takes a URL as an argument and returns a promise which can be used to process the response.

# Section 4: Processing the Response
Once the response has been received, it can be processed by using the then() method on the promise. This method takes two arguments, a success callback and an error callback. The success callback is used to process the response data and the error callback is used to handle any errors that may occur. The response data is typically a JSON object which can then be used in the application.
