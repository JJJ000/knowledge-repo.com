## What is a Module?
A module is a reusable chunk of code that can be imported into other code. It can contain functions, classes, variables, and other code that can be used by other programs.

## What is JSON?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.

## What Causes a Module to be Unavailable?
A module can be unavailable if it is misspelled, not loaded, or not present in the directory. It can also be unavailable if the module is not compatible with the version of the programming language being used.

## How to Resolve the Issue
To resolve the issue, first check that the module is spelled correctly and is loaded or present in the directory. If it is, then check that the module is compatible with the version of the programming language being used. If not, then update the version of the programming language or the module.
