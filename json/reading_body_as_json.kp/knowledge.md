[TOC]

# Section 1: Install the Required Libraries

In order to read a body as any valid JSON, you will need to install the following libraries:

- json
- requests

# Section 2: Make a Request

Once you have the required libraries installed, you can make a request to the API endpoint of your choice. You can use the `requests` library to make the request and get the response body as a string.

# Section 3: Parse the Response

Once you have the response body as a string, you can use the `json` library to parse the response into a valid JSON object. This will allow you to access the data in the response body as a JSON object.

# Section 4: Access the Data

Once you have parsed the response body into a valid JSON object, you can access the data in the response body by using the appropriate methods and properties of the JSON object. You can then use this data to do whatever you need to do with it.
