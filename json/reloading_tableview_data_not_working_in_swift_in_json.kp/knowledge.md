[TOC]

### Section 1 - Understanding the Issue 
The issue is that the tableView.reloadData() is not working in Swift in JSON. This could be due to several reasons, such as incorrect formatting of the JSON data, incorrect use of the API, or incorrect implementation of the tableView. 

### Section 2 - Troubleshooting
The first step in troubleshooting this issue is to check the format of the JSON data. Verify that all the data is properly formatted and that there are no syntax errors. Additionally, check that the API is being used correctly and that all the parameters are being passed correctly. 

### Section 3 - Implementing the TableView
Once the JSON data is properly formatted, the next step is to ensure that the tableView is implemented correctly. Make sure that the tableView is properly connected to the view controller and that the dataSource and delegate are properly set. Additionally, make sure that the tableView is being populated with the correct data. 

### Section 4 - Reloading the TableView
Finally, if all of the above steps are successful, the tableView.reloadData() should work properly. Make sure that the tableView is being reloaded in the correct place in the code and that the data is being properly updated.
