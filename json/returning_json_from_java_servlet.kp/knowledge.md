# Section 1: Set Up the HTTP Response

In order to return a JSON object from a Java Servlet, the first step is to set up the HTTP response. This is done using the HttpServletResponse object.

# Section 2: Create the JSON Object

Once the response is set up, the next step is to create the JSON object. This can be done using a JSON library such as Jackson or Gson. The object can then be populated with the desired data.

# Section 3: Write the JSON Object to the Response

Once the JSON object has been created, it can be written to the response using the HttpServletResponse object. This can be done by setting the Content-Type header to "application/json" and then writing the JSON object to the response using the write() method.

# Section 4: Return the Response

The final step is to return the response to the client. This can be done by calling the HttpServletResponse object's send() method. This will send the JSON object back to the client.
