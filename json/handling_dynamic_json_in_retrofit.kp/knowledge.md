1. Pre-Processing
------------------------
Before attempting to parse a dynamic JSON response with Retrofit, it is important to pre-process the response. This involves inspecting the JSON response to determine the structure and data types of the various elements. This can be done using a JSON parser such as Gson or Jackson. Once the structure of the response is known, the next step is to create a Java object to represent the JSON response.

2. Create a POJO
------------------------
Once the structure of the JSON response is known, the next step is to create a Java object to represent the response. This can be done with the help of a JSON to POJO converter such as jsonschema2pojo. This will generate a Java class that can be used to parse the JSON response.

3. Use Retrofit
------------------------
Once the POJO is created, Retrofit can be used to parse the JSON response. Retrofit uses annotations to map the JSON elements to the corresponding fields in the POJO. This makes it easy to parse the response and access the data.

4. Handle Errors
------------------------
It is important to handle any errors that may occur while parsing the JSON response. Retrofit provides a Callback interface which can be used to handle any errors that may occur. This allows the application to gracefully handle any errors and take the appropriate action.
