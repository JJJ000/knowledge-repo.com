## Introduction 
The .NET Framework is a software development platform developed by Microsoft. It allows developers to create applications that run on the Windows platform. The .NET Framework provides a common set of libraries and services that can be used by any .NET language, including C#, VB.NET, and F#.

## What is JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

## Referencing .NETFramework,Version=v4.5 in JSON
JSON does not directly support referencing the .NETFramework,Version=v4.5 framework. However, it is possible to use JSON to store information about .NETFramework,Version=v4.5. For example, you could store the version number in a JSON object and use that to determine which .NETFramework,Version=v4.5 libraries and services are available.
