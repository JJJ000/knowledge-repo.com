JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is used to store and exchange data between a server and a client application. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language and is easy to read and write.

2. What are Single Quotes in JSON?
Single quotes are used in JSON to denote string values. They are used to mark the beginning and end of a string, and must be used in pairs. For example, a string value such as "Hello World" would be written as 'Hello World'.

3. How to Parse a String as JSON with Single Quotes?
Parsing a string as JSON with single quotes is a simple process. First, the string must be enclosed in double quotes, which will be used to denote the beginning and end of the string. Then, the individual string values must be enclosed in single quotes. For example, the string "Hello World" would be written as " 'Hello World' ".

4. Benefits of Parsing Strings as JSON with Single Quotes
Parsing strings as JSON with single quotes has several benefits. First, it makes the JSON easier to read and understand. Second, it ensures that the JSON is valid and conforms to the JSON standard.
