## Section 1: Setting Up the Test Environment

In order to test a Spring MVC controller, you will need to set up a test environment with the necessary dependencies and configuration. This includes setting up the Spring MVC Framework, configuring the application context, and setting up the controller for testing.

## Section 2: Writing the Test

Once the test environment is set up, you can start writing the test. This includes creating a test class and writing the test method. The test method should take in a request and response object, and it should call the controller's handler method.

## Section 3: Verifying the Results

Once the test method has been written, you can verify the results. This can be done by asserting that the response object contains the expected JSON string. Additionally, you can use a JSON assertion library to verify that the JSON string is valid and contains the expected data.

## Section 4: Running the Test

Finally, you can run the test. This can be done using a unit testing framework such as JUnit or TestNG. Once the test has been run, you can view the results to verify that the controller is working as expected.
