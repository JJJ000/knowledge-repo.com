#Section 1: Setup

In order to render JSON for multiple models in JSON, the first step is to setup the application. This includes setting up the Ruby on Rails application, creating the models and controllers, and defining the routes.

#Section 2: Models

Once the application is set up, the next step is to create the models. Each model should include the necessary fields and associations. This will ensure that the data is correctly stored and retrieved from the database.

#Section 3: Controllers

The third step is to create the controllers. Each controller should contain the necessary actions to handle requests from the client. This includes actions to retrieve the data from the database and render it in JSON format.

#Section 4: Routes

Finally, the routes should be defined. This will determine which controller and action will be used to handle each request. Once the routes are defined, the application will be ready to render the JSON for multiple models.
