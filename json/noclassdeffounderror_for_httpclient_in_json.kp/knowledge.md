## Overview
Java is an object-oriented programming language. It is used to create various types of applications, including web-based applications. The Java language includes a number of libraries that provide functionality for web-based applications. One of these libraries is the Apache HttpClient library, which provides an easy way for sending and receiving HTTP requests and responses.

## What is the NoClassDefFoundError?
The NoClassDefFoundError is an error thrown by the Java Virtual Machine when it cannot find a class definition on the classpath. This can happen when a class is missing from the classpath, or when the class is present but it has been corrupted or is incompatible with the version of Java being used.

## Causes of NoClassDefFoundError
The NoClassDefFoundError can occur when the Apache HttpClient library is not included in the classpath. This can happen if the library is not included in the project dependencies, or if the version of the library is not compatible with the version of Java being used.

## Solutions
The NoClassDefFoundError can be resolved by ensuring that the Apache HttpClient library is included in the project dependencies and that the correct version of the library is being used. Additionally, the classpath should be checked to ensure that all necessary classes are present.
