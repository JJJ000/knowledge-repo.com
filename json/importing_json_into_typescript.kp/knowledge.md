### Section 1: Install TypeScript Compiler

In order to import a JSON file into a TypeScript file, you will need to install the TypeScript compiler. The TypeScript compiler can be installed using npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command in the command line:

```
npm install -g typescript
```

### Section 2: Create a TypeScript File

Once the TypeScript compiler is installed, you can create a TypeScript file. To do this, create a new file with the .ts extension.

### Section 3: Import the JSON File

Once the TypeScript file is created, you can import the JSON file by using the following syntax:

```
import * as myJSON from './myJSON.json';
```

### Section 4: Use the Imported JSON

Once the JSON file is imported, you can use it in your TypeScript file. To do this, you can reference the imported JSON file by using the following syntax:

```
let data = myJSON.data;
```
