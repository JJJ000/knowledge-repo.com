[TOC]

**Section 1: Pre-Formatting**

Before formatting the JSON string, it is important to make sure that it is valid JSON. This can be done by using a JSON validator or linter, such as JSONLint. This will help to identify any syntax errors that may be present.

**Section 2: Formatting**

Once the JSON string is valid, it can then be formatted. This can be done by using an online JSON formatter, such as JSONFormatter. This will help to make the JSON string more readable by adding indentations and line breaks.

**Section 3: Output**

Once the JSON string is formatted, it can then be output as a JSON object. This can be done by using the built-in JavaScript function `JSON.stringify()`. This will convert the JSON string into a valid JSON object that can be used in an AngularJS application.

**Section 4: Usage**

Once the JSON object is created, it can then be used in an AngularJS application. This can be done by using the built-in AngularJS function `$http.get()` to make an HTTP request for the JSON object. Once the request is successful, the JSON object can then be used in the application.
