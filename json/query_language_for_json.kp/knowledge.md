1. Overview

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a text-based, lightweight data-interchange format used for data exchange between applications. It is a language-independent format, meaning that it can be used in any language. JSON is a popular choice for data exchange and is often used in web services, APIs, and databases.

2. JSON Query Language

JSON does not have an official query language. However, there are several libraries and tools that can be used to query JSON data. For example, JsonPath is a popular library for querying JSON data. It is a lightweight query language that allows users to extract data from JSON documents. Additionally, MongoDB provides a query language for querying JSON data.

3. Alternatives

In addition to libraries and tools, there are also alternative query languages that can be used to query JSON data. For example, SQL (Structured Query Language) is a popular language for querying data and can be used to query JSON data. Additionally, XPath (XML Path Language) is a query language for XML documents, but can also be used to query JSON data.

4. Conclusion

JSON does not have an official query language, but there are several libraries, tools, and alternative query languages that can be used to query JSON data. JsonPath, MongoDB, SQL, and XPath are all popular options for querying JSON data.
