## Serialization

Serialization is the process of converting an object into a JSON string. This is done by taking the object's data and formatting it into a string that can be read by a JSON parser. This allows the object's data to be sent over a network or stored in a database.

## Deserialization

Deserialization is the opposite process of serialization. It is the process of taking a JSON string and converting it back into an object. This is done by parsing the JSON string and creating an object with the data from the string. The object can then be used in the application.
