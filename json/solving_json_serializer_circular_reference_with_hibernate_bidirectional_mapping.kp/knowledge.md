## Section 1: Understand the Circular Reference
A circular reference is a type of reference in which an object references itself or another object in a way that creates a cycle. This can occur when two or more objects reference each other in a bidirectional relationship. In the context of Hibernate, a bidirectional relationship occurs when two entities are related to each other in such a way that changes to one entity are reflected in the other.

## Section 2: Identify the Circular Reference
When using the Jackson JSON serializer, a circular reference can occur if two entities are mapped in a bidirectional relationship. This can be identified by looking for two entities that reference each other in the mapping file.

## Section 3: Avoid the Circular Reference
The best way to avoid a circular reference is to avoid bidirectional relationships in your mapping files. If this is not possible, then you can use the @JsonIgnore annotation on one of the entities to tell Jackson to ignore the reference. This will prevent the circular reference from being serialized.

## Section 4: Use Jackson's Reference Handling Features
Jackson also provides a number of features to help manage circular references. These include @JsonManagedReference and @JsonBackReference, which can be used to indicate the direction of the relationship. Additionally, Jackson provides the @JsonIdentityInfo annotation, which can be used to identify an object by a unique identifier such as an ID.
