tldr: Use the `JSON.parse` method and pass the `symbolize\_names` option set to `true` to convert a JSON formatted key value pair to a Ruby hash with symbol as key.

**Section 1: Understanding the JSON Format** 

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a text-based format that is language and platform independent. JSON is composed of two data structures: objects and arrays. Objects are composed of key-value pairs, while arrays are composed of values. 

**Section 2: Parsing the JSON Data** 

In order to convert a JSON formatted key-value pair to a Ruby hash with symbols as keys, the JSON data must first be parsed. This can be done using a JSON library, such as the one included in the Ruby standard library. 

**Section 3: Creating the Ruby Hash** 

Once the JSON data has been parsed, the Ruby hash can be created. This can be done by iterating over each key-value pair in the parsed JSON data and creating a new hash with the keys as symbols and the values as the corresponding values. 

**Section 4: Outputting the Ruby Hash**

Once the Ruby hash has been created, it can be outputted in a variety of ways. The most common way to output a Ruby hash is to use the `#inspect` method, which will return a string representation of the hash. Alternatively, the hash can be outputted as JSON using the `#to_json` method.
