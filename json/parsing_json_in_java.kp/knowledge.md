# Section 1: Overview

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used for exchanging data between a server and a client application. It is a language-independent text format, which means that it can be read and written by any programming language. JSON is commonly used for data serialization and data exchange in web applications.

# Section 2: Parsing JSON in Java

Parsing JSON in Java is relatively straightforward. Java provides a number of libraries for parsing and generating JSON data. The most popular library for parsing and generating JSON in Java is the Jackson library. The Jackson library provides an easy-to-use API for parsing and generating JSON data. Other popular libraries include Gson, JSON-Simple, and JSON-B.

# Section 3: Using the Jackson Library

The Jackson library provides a set of classes for parsing and generating JSON. The most commonly used classes are the ObjectMapper class, which is used for parsing JSON, and the JsonGenerator class, which is used for generating JSON. The ObjectMapper class can be used to parse JSON into Java objects, and the JsonGenerator class can be used to generate JSON from Java objects.

# Section 4: Example

Here is an example of how to parse a JSON string using the Jackson library:

String jsonString = "{\"name\":\"John\",\"age\":30}";
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
Person person = mapper.readValue(jsonString, Person.class);

The code above parses the JSON string into a Person object. The Person class is a simple POJO (Plain Old Java Object) with two fields: name and age. The ObjectMapper class is used to parse the JSON string into the Person object.
