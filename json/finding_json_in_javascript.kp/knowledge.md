1. What is JSON?
    JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is a text-based, human-readable format for representing simple data structures and associative arrays (called objects).

2. How to Access JSON in JavaScript?
    JSON can be accessed in JavaScript using the `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` methods. `JSON.parse()` is used to convert a JSON string into an object, and `JSON.stringify()` is used to convert an object into a JSON string.

3. Examples of JSON in JavaScript
    ```
    // Parse a JSON string into an object
    let jsonString = '{"name": "John", "age": 30}';
    let person = JSON.parse(jsonString);

    // Stringify an object into a JSON string
    let person = {name: "John", age: 30};
    let jsonString = JSON.stringify(person);
    ```

4. Benefits of Using JSON in JavaScript
    JSON is a very popular data format and is used in many modern web applications. It is easy to read and write, and can be quickly parsed and generated by JavaScript. JSON is also self-describing, so it is easy to understand the data structure without additional documentation.
