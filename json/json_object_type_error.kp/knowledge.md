# Section 1: What is JSON?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used for data storage and communication. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language and is easy to read and write.

# Section 2: What is a Dictionary in Python?

A dictionary in Python is a collection of key-value pairs. It is an unordered set of items that are mutable and can be used to store data. It is also known as an associative array or a hash table.

# Section 3: Why Can't a Dictionary be Used in JSON?

A dictionary in Python cannot be used in JSON because JSON only supports strings, numbers, arrays and objects as data types. A dictionary is not a valid data type in JSON as it is not one of the four supported types.

# Section 4: What Can be Used in JSON Instead of a Dictionary?

Instead of a dictionary, an object can be used in JSON. An object is a collection of key-value pairs, similar to a dictionary, but it is a valid data type in JSON.
