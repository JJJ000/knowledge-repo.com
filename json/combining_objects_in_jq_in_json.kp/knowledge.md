## Section 1: Creating a JSON Object

The first step in combining a sequence of objects into one object in JSON is to create a JSON object. This can be done by using the `{ }` characters to create an empty object, or by using the `{ key: value }` syntax to create an object with a single key-value pair.

## Section 2: Adding Elements to the JSON Object

Once an empty JSON object has been created, elements can be added to it by using the `.` operator. For example, if the object is called `myObject`, a new element can be added with the following syntax: `myObject.key = value`. This syntax allows for the addition of multiple elements to the object.

## Section 3: Combining Multiple Objects

If there are multiple objects that need to be combined into one JSON object, the `merge` function can be used. This function takes two or more objects and combines them into one. For example, if there are two objects called `obj1` and `obj2`, they can be combined into one object using the following syntax: `merge(obj1, obj2)`.

## Section 4: Outputting the JSON Object

Once the JSON object has been created and all the elements have been added, it can be outputted as a string using the `to_json` function. This function takes an object as an argument and returns a string representing the object in JSON format. For example, if the object is called `myObject`, it can be outputted as a string using the following syntax: `to_json(myObject)`.
