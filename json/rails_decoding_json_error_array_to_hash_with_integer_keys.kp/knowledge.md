### Section 1: Problem Analysis 

The problem occurs when jQuery sends JSON data to Rails, which then fails to decode the JSON correctly. The JSON data is sent as an array, but Rails incorrectly decodes it as a hash with integer keys.

### Section 2: Possible Causes

There are several possible causes for this issue. The most likely cause is that the JSON data being sent by jQuery is not properly formatted. Additionally, the Rails JSON decoder may not be configured correctly or may not be able to handle the data being sent.

### Section 3: Solutions

To solve this issue, the JSON data being sent by jQuery should be checked and properly formatted. Additionally, the Rails JSON decoder should be configured correctly and tested to ensure that it can handle the data being sent.

### Section 4: Conclusion

In conclusion, when jQuery sends JSON data to Rails and Rails fails to decode it correctly, it is most likely due to improper formatting of the JSON data or incorrect configuration of the Rails JSON decoder. To solve this issue, the JSON data should be checked and properly formatted, and the Rails JSON decoder should be configured correctly and tested.
