This means that the JSON string is trying to parse the list as a map, but the data type of the list does not match the data type of the map.

#Section 3: Solutions
The solution to this error is to ensure that the data type of the list matches the data type of the map. This can be done by either changing the data type of the list to be a map or by changing the data type of the map to be a list.

#Section 4: Conclusion
