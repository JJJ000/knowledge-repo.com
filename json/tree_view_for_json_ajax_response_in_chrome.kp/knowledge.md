# Yes

Google Chrome can display JSON AJAX responses as a tree. This is done using the Chrome Developer Tools.

# How to View JSON AJAX Response as Tree

1. Open the Chrome Developer Tools by pressing F12 or right-clicking on the page and selecting “Inspect”.

2. Select the “Network” tab.

3. Reload the page (or make the AJAX request again).

4. Select the request from the list.

5. Select the “Response” tab.

6. The response will be shown in a tree format.

# Benefits

The tree format makes it easier to view and understand the JSON AJAX response. It is also easier to debug and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
