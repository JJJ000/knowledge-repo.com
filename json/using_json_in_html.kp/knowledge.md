# Section 1: Preparing the JSON File

First, you must create a valid JSON file. This requires formatting your data in a specific way, with each element of the data contained in quotation marks and separated by commas. Additionally, nested elements must be contained in curly braces. Once you have created a valid JSON file, you can save it with a .json file extension.

# Section 2: Linking the JSON File

Once you have saved your JSON file, you can link it to your HTML document. This is done by adding a <script> tag to your HTML document and setting the src attribute to the path of your JSON file. This will allow your HTML document to access the data in your JSON file.

# Section 3: Accessing the Data

Once you have linked your JSON file, you can access the data by using the JavaScript object notation (JSON). This will allow you to access the data in your JSON file as a JavaScript object.

# Section 4: Using the Data

Once you have accessed the data, you can use it in your HTML document. This can be done by using the DOM methods to insert the data into your HTML document. Additionally, you can use JavaScript to manipulate the data and create dynamic web pages.
