[TOC]

# Section 1: JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is a language-independent format that is used to store and exchange data. JSON is often used in web applications, as it is easy to read and write.

# Section 2: Python

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. It is an interpreted language with dynamic semantics and object-oriented programming capabilities. Python is widely used for web development, data science, and scripting applications.

# Section 3: True in JSON

In JSON, the boolean value "true" is written as "true". This is the same as the boolean value True in Python.

# Section 4: Conversion

To convert "true" (JSON) to its Python equivalent, "True", simply copy the JSON boolean value and paste it into the Python code. The Python interpreter will then recognize the boolean value as True.
