### Server Side Validation

Server side validation is a process of validating user input data on the server side before it is sent to the client. This is done to ensure that the data is valid and secure. Server side validation can be done using a variety of languages such as PHP, Java, and ASP.NET. The server side validation process consists of checks such as data type checking, length checking, range checking, and pattern matching.

### Client Side Forms in Json

Client side forms in Json are forms that are created using the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) language. JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data between web applications. It is a text-based, human-readable format that is easy to read and understand. Client side forms in JSON allow developers to create forms that are easy to maintain and update. They also allow for dynamic data validation and custom styling.

### AngularJS

AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web application framework that is mainly maintained by Google. It is used to create single-page applications. AngularJS makes it easy to create forms with client side validation. It provides an easy way to create custom validators that can be applied to any form element. It also provides an easy way to set up custom error messages and display them to the user.

### Advantages

Using AngularJS for server side validation and client side forms in Json provides several advantages. It is easy to set up, maintain, and update forms. It also provides a more secure way to validate user input data as it is done on the server side. It also allows for custom validators and error messages, which makes it easier to customize forms. Finally, it is easier to style forms using AngularJS compared to other frameworks.
