### Section 1: Prepare the Data

Before you can send a JSON request using cURL, you must prepare the data you want to send. This can be done by creating a JSON object and then encoding it into a string.

### Section 2: Create the cURL Request

Once the data is prepared, you can create the cURL request. To do this, you will need to specify the URL of the server you are sending the request to, the type of request (POST), and the data you are sending.

### Section 3: Execute the Request

Once the request is created, you can execute it using the `curl_exec()` function. This will send the request to the server and return the response.

### Section 4: Handle the Response

The response from the server can be handled using the `curl_getinfo()` function. This can be used to get the status code, response headers, and any other information about the response.
