**Section 1: What is CORS?**

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. It is a mechanism that enables secure cross-domain data transfers.

**Section 2: Why is CORS Important?**

CORS is important because it allows web applications to access resources from other domains without compromising the security of the user's data. It also allows web applications to access resources from other domains without having to use the same origin policy.

**Section 3: What is Access-Control-Allow-Origin?**

Access-Control-Allow-Origin is an HTTP response header that specifies which domains are allowed to access a resource. It is used to secure cross-domain data transfers.

**Section 4: What Happens if CORS Header is Missing?**

If the CORS header is missing, then the browser will not be able to access the resource from another domain. This could lead to an error being displayed or the resource not being loaded.
