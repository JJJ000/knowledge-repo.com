tldr: The best practice for processing files (e.g. images) in a REST API is to base64 encode the files and send them as part of the JSON request body.

1. **File Encoding**
When sending files over a REST API, it is important to ensure that the file is encoded in the correct format. For example, an image file should be encoded as base64. This ensures that the file is sent to the server in a format that can be easily read and processed.

2. **File Size**
When sending files over a REST API, it is important to ensure that the file size is kept to a minimum. This will help to improve the performance of the API, as larger files will take longer to process. If the file size is too large, it may be necessary to compress the file before sending it.

3. **File Structure**
When sending files over a REST API, it is important to ensure that the file is structured properly. This will help to ensure that the file can be processed correctly. For example, an image file should be structured with a header that contains information such as the file type, size, and resolution.

4. **Security**
When sending files over a REST API, it is important to ensure that the file is secure. This can be done by encrypting the file before sending it. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the file is only accessible to authorized users. This can be done by using authentication and authorization protocols.
