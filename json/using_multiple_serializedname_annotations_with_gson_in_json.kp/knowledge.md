[TOC]

# Section 1: Overview

GSON @SerializedName allows developers to map JSON fields to Java objects, so that the fields in the JSON can be mapped to the corresponding Java fields. This allows the developer to have control over how the fields are named and how the data is represented in the JSON.

# Section 2: Syntax

The syntax for using @SerializedName is as follows:

@SerializedName("field_name")
Type fieldName;

Where "field_name" is the name of the field in the JSON, and "fieldName" is the name of the corresponding Java field.

# Section 3: Multiple @SerializedName

It is possible to use multiple @SerializedName annotations on a single field. This can be done by using a comma-separated list of names in the annotation:

@SerializedName("field_name_1", "field_name_2")
Type fieldName;

# Section 4: Use Cases

Using multiple @SerializedName annotations can be useful in situations where the JSON fields have different names than the corresponding Java fields. This can be helpful when dealing with legacy JSON data, or when the JSON fields are not consistent across different sources.
