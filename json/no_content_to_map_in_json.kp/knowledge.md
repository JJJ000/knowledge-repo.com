# Section 1: What is Jackson Parser
Jackson is a Java-based library used to parse JSON data format. It is a high-performance JSON processor that is used to parse, generate, transform, and query JSON data. It can be used to read and write JSON data as well as convert between Java objects and JSON data.

# Section 2: End-of-Input Jackson Parser
The end-of-input Jackson parser is a feature of the Jackson library that allows it to detect the end of the input data stream. This feature is useful when parsing JSON data that is not well-formed or contains errors. When the end-of-input Jackson parser detects the end of the data stream, it will stop trying to parse the data and will throw an exception.

# Section 3: What is Not Mappable
When the end-of-input Jackson parser is used, the data that is not mappable will not be processed. This includes data that is not valid JSON, data that is incomplete, or data that is not well-formed.

# Section 4: How to Avoid Not Mappable Data
To avoid not mappable data when using the end-of-input Jackson parser, it is important to ensure that the data being parsed is valid JSON and is well-formed. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the data is complete and does not contain any errors.
