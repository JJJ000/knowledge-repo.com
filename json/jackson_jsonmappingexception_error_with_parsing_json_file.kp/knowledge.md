tldr: The JSON file is not an array and hence cannot be deserialized using Jackson.

[TOC]

**Section 1: Introduction**

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and transport data. It is a language-independent format and is easy to read and write. Jackson is a popular library for parsing JSON data in Java. It is used to convert Java objects to JSON and vice versa. However, when attempting to parse JSON data using Jackson, you may encounter an error message such as "JsonMappingException - Cannot deserialize as out of START_ARRAY token".

**Section 2: Causes of the Error**

The "JsonMappingException - Cannot deserialize as out of START_ARRAY token" error is typically caused by a mismatch between the JSON data and the Java object. This means that the JSON data does not match the structure of the Java object, which prevents Jackson from being able to parse the data. For example, if the JSON data contains an array, but the Java object is expecting a single value, this error will be thrown.

**Section 3: Solutions**

The best way to solve this problem is to ensure that the JSON data matches the structure of the Java object. This can be done by inspecting both the JSON data and the Java object and making sure that they are compatible. If the JSON data is not in the correct format, it can be modified to match the structure of the Java object.

**Section 4: Conclusion**

In conclusion, the "JsonMappingException - Cannot deserialize as out of START_ARRAY token" error is caused by a mismatch between the JSON data and the Java object. To solve this problem, it is important to ensure that the JSON data matches the structure of the Java object. If the data is not in the correct format, it can be modified to match the structure of the Java object.
