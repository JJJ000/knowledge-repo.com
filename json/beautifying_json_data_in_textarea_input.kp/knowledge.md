# Prettify JSON Data

## Step 1: Load JSON Data

The first step is to load the JSON data into the textarea input. This can be done by either copying and pasting the JSON data into the textarea or by using a file uploader to upload the JSON file.

## Step 2: Prettify the JSON Data

Once the JSON data has been loaded into the textarea, the next step is to prettify the JSON data. This can be done by using a JSON prettifier tool such as JSONLint or by using a text editor such as Sublime Text or Atom.

## Step 3: Copy the Prettified JSON Data

Once the JSON data has been prettified, the next step is to copy the prettified JSON data from the textarea. This can be done by selecting the prettified JSON data and then copying it to the clipboard.

## Step 4: Paste the Prettified JSON Data

The last step is to paste the prettified JSON data into the textarea. This can be done by selecting the textarea and then pasting the prettified JSON data from the clipboard. The JSON data should now be properly formatted and ready for use.
