### Section 1: Define Object Prototype

In JavaScript, an object prototype is an object that serves as a blueprint for creating other objects. It contains properties and methods that will be shared by all the objects created from it. The object prototype is used to create objects with the same characteristics.

### Section 2: Parse JSON String

In order to parse a JSON string into an object prototype, the JSON string must first be converted into a JavaScript object. This can be done using the JSON.parse() method. This method takes a JSON string as an argument and returns a JavaScript object.

### Section 3: Create Object Prototype

Once the JSON string is converted into a JavaScript object, an object prototype can be created from it. This can be done by creating a constructor function that takes the JavaScript object as an argument. The constructor function can then be used to create objects with the same properties and methods as the JSON string.

### Section 4: Use Object Prototype

Once the object prototype is created, it can be used to create objects with the same characteristics. This can be done by calling the constructor function with the necessary arguments. The objects created from the object prototype will have the same properties and methods as the original JSON string.
