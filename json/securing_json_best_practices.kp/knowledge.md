1. Use HTTPS
    - HTTPS should be used to secure communication between the server and the client.
    - It ensures that the data is encrypted and cannot be intercepted by a third-party.

2. Limit Access
    - Access to JSON data should be limited to only those who need it.
    - Authentication and authorization should be used to limit access to the data.

3. Validate Input
    - All input should be validated to ensure that it is in the correct format and does not contain malicious code.

4. Sanitize Output
    - All output should be sanitized to ensure that it does not contain any sensitive information or malicious code.
