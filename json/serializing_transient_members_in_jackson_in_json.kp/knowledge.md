tldr: Jackson includes transient members in serialization because they are part of the object`s state, even though they are not saved during serialization.

## Introduction
Jackson is an open-source Java library that provides several ways to convert Java objects to JSON and vice versa. It provides annotations to control how the serialization and deserialization process should be done. One of the annotations provided by Jackson is `@Transient`, which is used to mark a field as not to be serialized or deserialized. However, sometimes Jackson serializes transient members also in JSON. In this article, we will discuss the reasons for this behavior.

## Reason 1: Jackson Does Not Follow Java Serialization Semantics
Java has a `transient` keyword that indicates the member should be ignored during the serialization process. However, Jackson does not follow this semantics strictly. Jackson considers `transient` keyword along with other annotations like `@JsonIgnore`, `@JsonProperty` to decide whether to serialize a field or not. If any other annotation is present, then Jackson ignores the `transient` keyword, and the field gets serialized. This behavior may result in serializing transient members in JSON.

## Reason 2: Custom Serialization Handlers
Jackson allows developers to write their custom serialization handlers. Suppose a developer writes a custom serialization handler that considers fields annotated with `transient`. In that case, these fields will also get serialized.

## Reason 3: External Constraints
Jackson can be used in various frameworks and environments that may have external constraints on the serialization process. For example, a framework may require all fields to be serialized for auditing purposes, ignoring the `transient` keyword. Therefore, Jackson serializes all fields, including transient ones, to satisfy the external constraint.

## Conclusion
Jackson provides an annotation `@Transient` to mark a field as not to be serialized. However, Jackson's behavior may cause transient members to be serialized in JSON. Developers should be aware of this behavior and use other annotations like `@JsonIgnore` or write custom serialization handlers to control serialization appropriately. Also, external constraints may exist, where transient members might be serialized, and developers should be aware of them.
