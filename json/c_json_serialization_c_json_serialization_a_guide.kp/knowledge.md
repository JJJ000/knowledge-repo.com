# Introduction
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used for serializing and deserializing data. It is commonly used for transmitting data between a server and web applications, as an alternative to XML. 

# C++ JSON Serialization
C++ provides a number of libraries for serializing and deserializing JSON data. These libraries include RapidJSON, JSON for Modern C++, and jsoncpp.

# RapidJSON
RapidJSON is a C++ library for parsing and serializing JSON data. It is designed to be fast and memory-efficient, and is suitable for use in both embedded and server-side applications. It supports a wide range of data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, objects, arrays, and booleans.

# JSON for Modern C++
JSON for Modern C++ is a header-only C++ library for serializing and deserializing JSON data. It is designed to be easy to use and is suitable for use in both embedded and server-side applications. It supports a wide range of data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, objects, arrays, and booleans.

# jsoncpp
jsoncpp is a C++ library for parsing and serializing JSON data. It is designed to be fast and memory-efficient, and is suitable for use in both embedded and server-side applications. It supports a wide range of data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, objects, arrays, and booleans.
