# Content-Type Header

The Content-Type header is an HTTP header that indicates the type of data that the server has sent in the response. It is used to tell the client what type of data is being returned so that the client can interpret the data correctly.

# JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used for exchanging data between different applications. It is a text-based, human-readable format for representing simple data structures and objects. JSON is language-independent and can be used in any programming language.

# Content-Type and JSON

When sending data in JSON format, the Content-Type header should be set to "application/json". This informs the client that the data being sent is in JSON format and should be interpreted as such.
