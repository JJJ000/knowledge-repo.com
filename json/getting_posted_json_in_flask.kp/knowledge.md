[TOC]

# Section 1: Set Up

To get POSTed JSON in Flask, you need to set up the application. This includes importing the Flask library and setting up the routes.

# Section 2: Retrieve JSON

Once the application is set up, you can use the `request` object to retrieve the JSON data. The `request` object contains a `get_json()` method that can be used to retrieve the JSON data.

# Section 3: Parse JSON

Once the JSON data is retrieved, it can be parsed using the `json` library. The `json.loads()` method can be used to parse the JSON data and convert it into a Python dictionary.

# Section 4: Access Data

Once the JSON data is parsed, you can access the data by using the keys of the dictionary. For example, if the JSON data contains a key called `name`, you can access it by using the `dictionary['name']` syntax.
