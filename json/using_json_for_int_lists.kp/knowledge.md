# Section 1: List of Int
A list of int is a collection of integers, which are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero. For example, the following is a list of int: [1, -3, 0, 4].

# Section 2: JSON Format
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to represent data in a structured way. In JSON, a list of int is represented as an array of numbers, as shown in the example below:

```
[1, -3, 0, 4]
```

# Section 3: JSON Example
Below is a full example of a list of int represented in JSON format:

```
{
  "listOfInt": [1, -3, 0, 4]
}
```

# Section 4: Advantages of Using JSON
Using JSON to represent data has several advantages. It is human-readable, easy to parse and generate, and is supported by many languages and platforms. JSON is also a great way to transfer data between different systems, as it is lightweight and can be easily serialized and deserialized.
