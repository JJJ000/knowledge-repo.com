tldr: Streaming the JSON file is the recommended approach for reading large JSON files.

[TOC]

### Section 1: Streams

One way to read large JSON files is to use streams. Streams allow you to read and process the data in chunks, instead of loading the entire file into memory. This can be done using the Node.js `fs` module, which provides a `createReadStream()` method.

### Section 2: Parsing

Once the stream is created, the data can be parsed using a library such as `JSONStream`. This library provides a parser that can be used to parse the data from the stream.

### Section 3: Asynchronous Processing

Once the data is parsed, it can be processed asynchronously. This can be done using the `async` library, which provides a set of functions for performing asynchronous operations.

### Section 4: Error Handling

Finally, it is important to handle any errors that may occur while reading and parsing the data. This can be done using the `try/catch` statement, which allows you to catch any errors that may occur and handle them appropriately.
