## What is JSON?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format used to store and exchange data. It is a text-based format that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate.

## What is a SyntaxError?
A SyntaxError occurs when the syntax of a program is incorrect. It can be caused by a missing or unexpected token, an invalid character, or an invalid sequence of characters.

## What is the Unexpected Token Error?
The Unexpected Token Error occurs when an unexpected character is encountered in a program. In the case of JSON, this error occurs when a character other than a valid JSON token is encountered.

## How to Fix the SyntaxError
The SyntaxError can be fixed by ensuring that all characters in the JSON string are valid JSON tokens. Additionally, any invalid characters should be removed or replaced with valid JSON tokens.
