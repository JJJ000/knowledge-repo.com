# Section 1: Overview

tsconfig.json is a configuration file that specifies the compiler options to be used when building a TypeScript project. It is used to control how the TypeScript compiler compiles TypeScript code into JavaScript.

# Section 2: Error

The error "No inputs were found in config file" occurs when the tsconfig.json file does not contain any compiler options. This means that the compiler has no instructions on how to compile the TypeScript code.

# Section 3: Causes

This error can occur for several reasons, including:

- The tsconfig.json file is missing or corrupted.
- The tsconfig.json file does not contain any compiler options.
- The compiler options specified in the tsconfig.json file are incorrect or outdated.

# Section 4: Solution

To resolve this error, you should ensure that the tsconfig.json file is present and correct. You should also ensure that all the necessary compiler options are specified in the file.
