[TOC]

1. Create the Database Table 

To store JSON objects in an SQLite database, you will need to create a table that can store the JSON data. You can use the following SQL statement to create a table with a column to store JSON objects:

```sql
CREATE TABLE json_table (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    json_data TEXT
);
```

2. Insert JSON Data into the Table 

Once the table is created, you can insert JSON data into the table using the following SQL statement:

```sql
INSERT INTO json_table (json_data) 
VALUES (?);
```

The `?` placeholder should be replaced with the actual JSON data you want to store.

3. Retrieve JSON Data from the Table 

To retrieve JSON data from the table, you can use the following SQL statement:

```sql
SELECT json_data FROM json_table WHERE id = ?;
```

The `?` placeholder should be replaced with the id of the row containing the JSON data you want to retrieve.

4. Update JSON Data in the Table 

To update JSON data in the table, you can use the following SQL statement:

```sql
UPDATE json_table 
SET json_data = ? 
WHERE id = ?;
```

The `?` placeholders should be replaced with the new JSON data you want to store and the id of the row containing the JSON data you want to update.
