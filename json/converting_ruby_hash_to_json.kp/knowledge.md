## Step 1: Install the JSON Gem

In order to convert a Ruby hash object to JSON, you will need to install the JSON gem. This can be done by running the following command in your terminal:

`gem install json`

## Step 2: Require the JSON Gem

Once the JSON gem has been installed, you will need to require it in your Ruby program. This can be done by adding the following line to the top of your program:

`require 'json'`

## Step 3: Convert the Hash Object to JSON

Once the JSON gem has been required, you can convert a Ruby hash object to JSON by using the `to_json` method. For example, if you have a hash object stored in a variable called `my_hash`, you can convert it to JSON by running the following command:

`my_hash.to_json`

## Step 4: Output the JSON

Once the hash object has been converted to JSON, you can output it to the console or save it to a file. For example, to output the JSON to the console, you can use the `puts` command:

`puts my_hash.to_json`
