tldr: Use the Decodable protocol to decode a nested JSON struct by defining a custom struct that conforms to the protocol and mapping the struct`s properties to the JSON keys.

# Section 1: Create a Model

The first step in decoding a nested JSON struct with Swift Decodable protocol is to create a model that matches the structure of the JSON data. This model should include properties for each of the keys in the JSON data. 

# Section 2: Create a Decoder

The next step is to create a decoder for the JSON data. This can be done by creating a new instance of the JSONDecoder class. The decoder will be used to convert the JSON data into an instance of the model created in the previous step.

# Section 3: Decode the Data

Once the model and decoder have been created, the data can be decoded using the decoder's decode method. This method takes in the data to be decoded and the type of the model as parameters. The decoder will then attempt to convert the JSON data into an instance of the model.

# Section 4: Handle Errors

Finally, it is important to handle any errors that may occur during the decoding process. The decode method will throw an error if the data is not in the correct format or if the data does not match the model. To handle this, the decode method should be wrapped in a do-catch block. This will allow the errors to be caught and handled appropriately.
