tldr: Use the JSONObject`s `get()` method to retrieve the value and then use the `instanceof` operator to check the type of the value.

1. Retrieve the Value from JSONObject

To check the type of a value from a JSONObject in Json, the first step is to retrieve the value from the JSONObject. This can be done using the get() method of the JSONObject class. The get() method takes the key of the value as an argument and returns the value associated with the key.

2. Check the Type of the Value

Once the value has been retrieved from the JSONObject, the second step is to check the type of the value. This can be done using the instanceof operator. The instanceof operator takes an object as an argument and returns true if the object is an instance of the specified type.

3. Cast the Value to the Appropriate Type

If the type of the value is not the expected type, the third step is to cast the value to the appropriate type. This can be done using the cast() method of the JSONObject class. The cast() method takes the key of the value as an argument and casts the value to the specified type.

4. Use the Value

Once the value has been cast to the appropriate type, the fourth step is to use the value. This can be done using the appropriate methods or operations for the type of the value. For example, if the value is a String, the appropriate methods or operations for manipulating Strings can be used.
