[TOC]

# Section 1: Install PostgreSQL

Before you can parse JSON in PostgreSQL, you need to install PostgreSQL on your system. PostgreSQL can be downloaded from the official website and installed on your system.

# Section 2: Create Database

Once PostgreSQL is installed, you need to create a database. You can do this by using the CREATE DATABASE command. This will create a database with the given name.

# Section 3: Load JSON Data

Once the database is created, you need to load the JSON data into the database. You can do this by using the COPY command. This command will take a file containing the JSON data and load it into the database.

# Section 4: Parse JSON

Once the JSON data is loaded into the database, you can parse the data. You can do this by using the JSON functions provided by PostgreSQL. These functions will allow you to extract the data from the JSON and use it in your queries.
