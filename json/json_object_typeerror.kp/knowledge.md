# Solution

## Overview
When working with JSON objects, it is important to remember that the object must be a string, not a byte. If the object is a byte, it will result in a TypeError.

## Causes
The primary cause of this TypeError is attempting to convert a byte into a JSON object. This can occur when the JSON object is read from a file or received from a network connection.

## Prevention
To prevent this error from occurring, it is important to ensure that the JSON object is a string before attempting to parse it. This can be done by using the `str()` function to convert the object to a string.

## Conclusion
In summary, the TypeError occurs when attempting to convert a byte into a JSON object. To prevent this error, it is important to convert the object to a string before attempting to parse it.
