**Contents**

[TOC]

**Introduction:**

In this example, we will demonstrate how to use jQuery, PHP, and JSONP to retrieve and display data from a remote server. 

**Section 1: Creating the PHP script**

To begin, we will create a simple PHP script that will return some data in JSON format. This script can be hosted on a remote server, or on the same server where the HTML and JavaScript files will be hosted.

```
<?php
  // array of data to be returned in JSON format
  $data = array(
      array("name" => "John", "age" => 30),
      array("name" => "Jane", "age" => 25),
      array("name" => "Bob", "age" => 40)
  );
  
  // set the content type header to application/json
  header('Content-Type: application/json');
  
  // return the data in JSON format
  echo json_encode($data);
?>
```

This script creates an array of data, sets the content type header to "application/json", and then encodes the data as JSON using the `json_encode` function. When this script is executed, it will return the data in JSON format.

**Section 2: Retrieving the data using jQuery**

Next, we will use jQuery to retrieve the data from the PHP script. We will use the `$.getJSON` function to make the AJAX request to the PHP script.

```
$.getJSON('http://example.com/data.php?callback=?', function(data) {
  // process the data
});
```

In this code, we pass the URL of the PHP script to the `$.getJSON` function. We also include the parameter `callback=?` to indicate that we want to use JSONP. The `callback` parameter tells the server what JavaScript function to wrap the response in. jQuery will automatically generate a unique callback function name and append it to the URL. 

**Section 3: Processing the data using JavaScript**

Once we have retrieved the data using jQuery, we can process it using JavaScript. In the callback function, we can access the data as a JavaScript object.

```
$.getJSON('http://example.com/data.php?callback=?', function(data) {
  // process the data
  $.each(data, function(index, person) {
    console.log(person.name + ' is ' + person.age + ' years old.');
  });
});
```

In this code, we use the `$.each` function to iterate over the data and log each person's name and age to the console.

**Section 4: Conclusion**

In this example, we have demonstrated how to use jQuery, PHP, and JSONP to retrieve and display data from a remote server. By using JSONP, we are able to bypass the same-origin policy and retrieve data from a different domain. This technique is useful for building web applications that need to retrieve data from other servers.
