## Section 1: Using JavaScript

The most straightforward way to parse JSON without using a library is to use the built-in JavaScript `JSON.parse()` function. This function takes a JSON string as an argument and returns a JavaScript object.

## Section 2: Using Regular Expressions

Another way to parse JSON without using a library is to use regular expressions. Regular expressions can be used to find specific patterns in strings and can be used to parse JSON strings. This approach is more complex and requires more knowledge of regular expressions.

## Section 3: Using a Custom Parser

A third option is to write a custom parser for JSON. This approach requires more knowledge of programming and may be more time consuming than using a library, but it can be used if no library is available.

## Section 4: Using an Online Parser

The fourth option is to use an online JSON parser. There are many online tools available that can parse a JSON string and return the data in a readable format. This approach is the simplest and requires no programming knowledge.
