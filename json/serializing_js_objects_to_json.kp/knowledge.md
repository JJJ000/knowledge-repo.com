#### Section 1: Overview

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format used for exchanging data between a web browser and a server. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language, and is easily readable by humans. JSON is commonly used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection.

#### Section 2: Serializing a JavaScript Object

Serializing a JavaScript object into a JSON string involves converting the object into a string representation of its data. This can be done using the `JSON.stringify()` method in JavaScript. This method takes a JavaScript object as an argument and returns a JSON string representation of the object.

#### Section 3: Example

For example, if we have the following JavaScript object:

```javascript
let obj = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 25
};
```

We can serialize it into a JSON string using the `JSON.stringify()` method:

```javascript
let jsonString = JSON.stringify(obj);
```

The resulting JSON string would look like this:

```json
{"name":"John","age":25}
```

#### Section 4: Benefits

Serializing a JavaScript object into a JSON string provides a number of benefits. It is a lightweight format that is easy to read and write, and it is supported by most web browsers and servers. It is also language-independent, so it can be used to exchange data between different programming languages.
