### Request JSON

Python has a built-in module called `urllib` that can be used to fetch URLs. This module provides a number of functions that can be used to request and receive data from an API. To request a JSON object from a URL, use the `urllib.request.urlopen()` function. This function takes a URL as an argument and returns a file-like object that can be used to read the contents of the JSON object.

### Process JSON

Once the JSON object has been requested, the data can be processed using the `json` module. This module provides a number of functions that can be used to decode the JSON object into a Python dictionary. To decode the JSON object, use the `json.loads()` function. This function takes a JSON string as an argument and returns a Python dictionary.

### Access Data

Once the JSON object has been decoded, the data can be accessed using the keys in the Python dictionary. To access a specific value, use the `dict[key]` syntax. This syntax takes a dictionary and a key as arguments and returns the value associated with the key.

### Example

Here is an example of how to request and process a JSON object using Python:

```python
import urllib.request
import json

# Request the JSON object
response = urllib.request.urlopen('http://example.com/data.json')

# Read the contents of the response
data = response.read()

# Decode the JSON object
data_dict = json.loads(data)

# Access the data
value = data_dict['key']
```
