### Solution

#### 1. Deserializing JSON Arrays

JSON arrays can be deserialized into an array of objects. The objects must have the same structure and data type as the elements in the array. The deserialization process will iterate over the elements in the array and create an object for each element.

#### 2. Deserializing JSON Objects

JSON objects can be deserialized into a single object. The object must have the same structure and data type as the JSON object being deserialized. The deserialization process will iterate over the properties of the object and create an object with the same structure and data type.

#### 3. Limitations

Deserializing a JSON array into a single object is not possible because the array elements have different structure and data types. Deserializing a JSON object into an array is also not possible because the object properties have different structure and data types.

#### 4. Conclusion

In conclusion, it is not possible to deserialize a JSON array into a single object or a JSON object into an array. The objects must have the same structure and data type as the elements in the array or the properties of the object in order to be deserialized correctly in JSON.
