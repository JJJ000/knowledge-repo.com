## Section 1: Parsing the JSON String

The first step to creating a HashMap from a JSON String is to parse the JSON String. This can be done with the help of a JSON parser library such as Gson or Jackson. The parser will take the JSON String and convert it into an object or a Map.

## Section 2: Creating the HashMap

Once the JSON String is parsed, the next step is to create the HashMap. This can be done by iterating over the parsed object or Map and creating a new HashMap with the keys and values from the parsed object.

## Section 3: Adding Values to the HashMap

The next step is to add values to the HashMap. This can be done by using the put() method of the HashMap. The put() method takes two arguments, the key and the value, and adds the key-value pair to the HashMap.

## Section 4: Retrieving Values from the HashMap

The final step is to retrieve values from the HashMap. This can be done by using the get() method of the HashMap. The get() method takes a key as an argument and returns the associated value from the HashMap.
