# Section 1: Deserialize with Newtonsoft.Json

The most popular way to convert a JSON string to a JSON object in C# is to deserialize the string using the [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json) library.

# Section 2: Create a JSON Object

To create a JSON object from a JSON string, you must first create a `JObject` instance from the `JsonConvert` class. This class contains a `DeserializeObject` method that takes a JSON string as a parameter and returns a `JObject` instance.

# Section 3: Access the Properties

Once you have the `JObject` instance, you can access the properties of the JSON object by using the `GetValue` method. This method takes the name of the property as a parameter and returns the value of the property as an `object`.

# Section 4: Cast the Value to the Appropriate Type

Finally, you can cast the value returned by the `GetValue` method to the appropriate type. For example, if the property is a string, you can cast the value to a `string` type.
