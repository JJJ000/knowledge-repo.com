# Section 1: What is JSON Serialization?
JSON serialization is the process of converting data structures or objects into a string of characters in a specific format. It is commonly used to exchange data between web applications and web services.

# Section 2: What is a Set?
A set is a collection of distinct elements or values. It is an unordered collection of objects, meaning that the order of the objects in the set is not important.

# Section 3: How to Serialize a Set in JSON
In order to serialize a set in JSON, the set must first be converted into an array. This can be done by using the `Array.from()` method. Once the set is converted into an array, the array can then be converted into a JSON string using the `JSON.stringify()` method.

# Section 4: Example
For example, if we have a set of strings:
```
let mySet = new Set(['a', 'b', 'c']);
```

We can convert it into a JSON string like this:
```
let jsonString = JSON.stringify(Array.from(mySet));
// jsonString = '["a", "b", "c"]'
```
