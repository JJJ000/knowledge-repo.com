## 1. Overview 
Java 8 introduced LocalDate, which is a new class that is part of the new java.time package. It provides classes for representing dates and times. It is immutable and thread-safe, making it an ideal choice for representing date and time values. LocalDate can be used to store and manipulate date values without timezone information. 

## 2. Serialization 
When serializing a LocalDate object to JSON, Jackson provides a default format for the output. The default format is ISO-8601, which is a standard format for representing date and time values. The format is yyyy-MM-dd, which is the same format used by the java.time.LocalDate class. 

## 3. Deserialization 
When deserializing a LocalDate object from JSON, Jackson will attempt to parse the JSON string into a valid LocalDate object. If the string is not in the ISO-8601 format, Jackson will throw an exception. It is possible to customize the deserialization process by providing a custom deserializer. This allows you to specify a different format for the JSON string. 

## 4. Conclusion 
Java 8 LocalDate objects can be serialized and deserialized using Jackson. By default, Jackson will use the ISO-8601 format for serialization and deserialization. It is possible to customize the deserialization process by providing a custom deserializer.
