# Section 1: Lowercase

In JSON, field names are always written in lowercase. This is because the JSON standard does not allow for any capitalization in field names.

# Section 2: Object Keys

Object keys in JSON are always written in lowercase. This is because the JSON standard does not allow for any capitalization in object keys.

# Section 3: Property Names

Property names in JSON are also always written in lowercase. This is because the JSON standard does not allow for any capitalization in property names.

# Section 4: Naming Conventions

Although JSON does not allow for any capitalization in field names, object keys, or property names, it is still good practice to use consistent naming conventions when writing JSON. This means that all field names, object keys, and property names should be written in the same case (either lowercase or uppercase). This will help to make the JSON code more readable and easier to understand.
