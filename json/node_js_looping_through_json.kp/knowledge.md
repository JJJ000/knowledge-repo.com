tldr: To loop through JSON with node.js, you can use the forEach method on the JSON object.

**Contents**

[TOC]

**Section 1: Setting up the Environment**

1. Install the necessary packages for working with JSON in Node.js.

2. Create a JavaScript file to store your code.

3. Import the JSON data into your JavaScript file.

**Section 2: Looping Through JSON**

1. Use the `for` loop to iterate through the JSON data.

2. Inside the loop, use the `Object.keys()` method to access the keys of each object.

3. Use the `Object.values()` method to access the values of each object.

4. Use the `console.log()` method to print out the key-value pairs of each object.

**Section 3: Accessing Nested Objects**

1. Use the `for` loop to iterate through the JSON data.

2. Inside the loop, use the `Object.keys()` method to access the keys of each object.

3. Use the `Object.values()` method to access the values of each object.

4. Use the `for..in` loop to iterate through the nested objects.

5. Use the `console.log()` method to print out the key-value pairs of each nested object.

**Section 4: Working with Arrays**

1. Use the `for` loop to iterate through the JSON data.

2. Inside the loop, use the `Object.keys()` method to access the keys of each object.

3. Use the `Object.values()` method to access the values of each object.

4. Use the `for..of` loop to iterate through the arrays.

5. Use the `console.log()` method to print out the elements of each array.
