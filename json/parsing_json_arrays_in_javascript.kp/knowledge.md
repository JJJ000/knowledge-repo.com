### Section 1: Accessing JSON Array

JSON arrays are accessed by index, with the first element being at index 0. To access a specific element in an array, use the index number of the element inside square brackets.

### Section 2: Parsing JSON Array

To parse a JSON array, use the JSON.parse() method. This method takes a string containing JSON data and parses it into an array of JavaScript objects.

### Section 3: Iterating Through JSON Array

Once the JSON array has been parsed, it can be iterated through using a for loop. The loop should use the length of the parsed array to iterate through each element.

### Section 4: Accessing Elements of JSON Array

Once the loop has iterated through the JSON array, each element can be accessed by using the index of the element. The index of the element can be used to access the element's data, such as its properties and values.
