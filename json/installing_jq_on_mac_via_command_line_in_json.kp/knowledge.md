2. Select the appropriate version for your operating system (in this case, macOS).

## Installing JQ

2. Move the `jq` binary to the desired location. It is recommended to move it to a directory that is part of your systemâ€™s PATH.
3. Make sure the `jq` binary is executable by running the command `chmod +x jq`

## Testing the Installation
