## Solution 1: Check the JSON String

The first step to handle a JSON decode error when nothing is returned is to check the JSON string for any errors. If the string is valid, then you can move on to the next step. Otherwise, you can use a JSON validator to identify and fix any errors in the string.

## Solution 2: Check the API Response

The next step is to check the API response for any errors. If the API is returning an error, then you can use the API documentation to troubleshoot the issue. Additionally, you can contact the API provider for help if needed.

## Solution 3: Use a Debugging Tool

If the API response is valid, then you can use a debugging tool to identify the issue. A debugging tool can help you identify any issues in the code that are causing the JSON decode error.

## Solution 4: Check the Data Types

Lastly, you can check the data types of the variables that are being used in the JSON decode process. If the data types are incorrect, then it can cause the JSON decode error. Once you identify any incorrect data types, you can adjust them accordingly.
