**Section 1: What is CORS?**

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the resource originated. This mechanism is used to enable cross-domain communication from the browser.

**Section 2: What is Vue Axios?**

Vue Axios is an HTTP client library for the JavaScript library Vue.js. It provides an easy-to-use interface for making HTTP requests from within Vue applications.

**Section 3: What is the CORS Policy in Vue Axios?**

The CORS policy in Vue Axios is a set of rules that determine how a web browser handles requests from a different domain. It is designed to protect the user from malicious websites that may try to hijack user data or perform other malicious activities.

**Section 4: What is the 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' Error in Vue Axios?**

The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' error in Vue Axios occurs when the server does not include the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header in its response. This header is used to indicate which domains are allowed to make requests to the server. If this header is not included, then the browser will block the request and return an error.
