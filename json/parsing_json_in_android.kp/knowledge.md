[TOC]

# Section 1: Add Dependency

In order to parse JSON in Android, you need to add a dependency to your project. The most popular library for JSON parsing is [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson). To add Gson to your project, add the following line to your build.gradle file:

`implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.5'`

# Section 2: Create a Model

The next step is to create a model class that will represent the JSON data. This class should contain all the fields that are present in the JSON data. For example, if the JSON data contains a list of users, then the model class should contain fields for each user, such as name, email, etc.

# Section 3: Parse the JSON

Once the model class is created, we can use Gson to parse the JSON data. To do this, we need to create an instance of Gson and then call the `fromJson()` method, passing in the JSON data and the model class. This will return an instance of the model class with all the data from the JSON.

# Section 4: Use the Data

Finally, we can use the data from the parsed JSON in our application. For example, if the JSON contains a list of users, we can use the data to populate a list view or display the data in some other way.
