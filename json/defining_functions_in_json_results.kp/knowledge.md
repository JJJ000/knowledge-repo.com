**No, it is not valid to define functions in JSON results.**

## Reasons
1. JSON is a data-interchange format and not a programming language. It does not support the definition of functions.
2. JSON does not support the concept of scope, which is necessary for defining and calling functions.
3. JSON does not allow for the execution of code, which is necessary for calling a function.
4. JSON does not support complex data types, such as functions, which are necessary for defining and calling functions.
