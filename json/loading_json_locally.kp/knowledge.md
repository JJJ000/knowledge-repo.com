# Section 1: Retrieve the File

The first step to loading a local JSON file in JavaScript is to retrieve the file. This can be done using the `XMLHttpRequest` object.

# Section 2: Parse the File

Once the file has been retrieved, it must be parsed into a JavaScript object. This can be done using the `JSON.parse()` method.

# Section 3: Access the Data

Once the JSON file is parsed, the data can be accessed using dot notation.

# Section 4: Error Handling

Finally, it is important to handle any errors that may occur while retrieving or parsing the file. This can be done using the `try-catch` statement.
