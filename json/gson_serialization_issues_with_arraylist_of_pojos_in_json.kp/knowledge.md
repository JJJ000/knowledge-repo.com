tldr: The issue could be that the POJO`s do not have a default constructor or their fields are not public.

**Section 1: Overview**
Gson is a Java library used for serializing and deserializing Java objects into and from JSON. It can be used to serialize an ArrayList of POJO's (Plain Old Java Objects) into a JSON string. However, there can be trouble when attempting to serialize an ArrayList of POJO's in JSON.

**Section 2: Common Issues**
One common issue when serializing an ArrayList of POJO's in JSON is that the objects may not be properly serialized. This can occur if the POJO's contain fields that are not primitive types or other serializable types. In this case, Gson will not be able to properly serialize the objects, resulting in an incomplete or incorrect JSON string.

Another issue is that Gson does not support the serialization of generic types. This means that if the ArrayList contains a generic type, such as a List or a Map, Gson will not be able to serialize it.

**Section 3: Solutions**
The best way to resolve these issues is to ensure that the POJO's contain only serializable types. This includes primitive types, such as int and String, as well as other serializable types, such as Date and BigDecimal.

If the POJO's contain generic types, such as a List or a Map, the best solution is to convert them to a serializable type before serializing them. For example, a List can be converted to an array or a Map can be converted to a JSONObject.

**Section 4: Conclusion**
Gson is a powerful library for serializing and deserializing Java objects into and from JSON. However, there can be trouble when serializing an ArrayList of POJO's in JSON. The best way to resolve these issues is to ensure that the POJO's contain only serializable types and to convert any generic types to a serializable type before serializing them.
