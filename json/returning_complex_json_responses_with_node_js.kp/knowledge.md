## 1. Prepare the Data

The first step in returning a complex JSON response is to prepare the data. This means gathering all the necessary data from the database or other sources, and formatting it into an object that can be easily serialized into JSON. 

## 2. Create the Response Object

Once the data has been prepared, the next step is to create the response object. This should contain all the data that needs to be sent back to the client, as well as any additional information required for the response, such as status codes and error messages.

## 3. Serialize the Response

Once the response object has been created, the next step is to serialize it into JSON. This can be done using a library such as Node.js' `JSON.stringify()` method.

## 4. Return the Response

Finally, the response can be returned to the client by using the `res.json()` method. This will return the response as a JSON string, which can then be used by the client.
