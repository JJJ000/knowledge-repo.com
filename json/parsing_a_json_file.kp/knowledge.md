### Section 1: Importing Libraries

In order to parse a JSON file in Python, you will need to import the `json` library. This library provides the `load()` and `loads()` functions which can be used to parse JSON data.

### Section 2: Reading a JSON File

To read a JSON file, you can use the `open()` function to open the file and then use the `load()` function to parse the contents of the file. This will return a Python dictionary containing the contents of the JSON file.

### Section 3: Accessing Data

Once the JSON file has been parsed, you can access the data stored in it by using the keys of the Python dictionary. For example, if the JSON file contains a list of objects, you can access the list by using the key associated with the list.

### Section 4: Writing a JSON File

In order to write a JSON file, you can use the `dump()` function to write the contents of a Python dictionary to a JSON file. This will create a new JSON file containing the data stored in the Python dictionary.
