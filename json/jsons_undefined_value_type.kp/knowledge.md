## Null
Null is a special value type in JSON which is used to indicate an absence of value. It is represented by the keyword "null".

## Usage
Null is often used to represent an unknown or empty value. It can also be used to indicate that a value is not applicable.

## Syntax
In JSON, null is written with a lowercase n:
```
"myValue": null
```

## Example
For example, the following JSON has a null value for the "age" property:
```
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": null
}
```
