**Encoding Special Characters**

JSON strings are composed of Unicode characters. Unicode characters are a set of characters that can be used to represent all of the languages of the world. As a result, some special characters, such as those with accent marks, may need to be encoded as a sequence of characters so they can be properly represented in a JSON string.

**Using the json_encode Function**

The json_encode function is used to convert a value to a JSON string. When encoding a value that contains special characters, the json_encode function will automatically encode those characters as a sequence of Unicode characters. This ensures that the special characters are properly represented in the resulting JSON string.

**Example**

For example, if a value contains the character “é”, it will be encoded as “\u00e9” in the resulting JSON string.

**Alternatives**

If the json_encode function is not available, an alternative method of encoding special characters is to use the PHP function urlencode. This function will encode any special characters as URL-safe characters, which can then be used in a JSON string.
