[TOC]

#### Section 1: Create the JSON Object

Create a JSON object with the data that you would like to send. This can be done with a JavaScript object literal or by using a library like `JSON.stringify()`.

#### Section 2: Create the HTML Form

Create an HTML form with the appropriate input fields. Make sure to set the `enctype` attribute to `"multipart/form-data"` to ensure that the form data is sent in the correct format.

#### Section 3: Submit the Form

Submit the form using the `POST` method. This can be done with a `<form>` element or with an AJAX request.

#### Section 4: Retrieve the JSON Object

Retrieve the JSON object from the request body on the server-side. This can be done using a library like `JSON.parse()` or by manually parsing the request body.
