1. **Retrieve the JSON Value**

To convert a Postgres JSON value to an integer, the first step is to retrieve the JSON value from the database. This can be done using the `->` operator to access the value of a specific key in the JSON object. For example, if the JSON object is stored in a column named `json_data` and the value to be retrieved is stored under the key `value`, the following query can be used:

```sql
SELECT json_data->'value' AS json_value FROM table;
```

2. **Cast the Value to an Integer**

Once the value has been retrieved, it must be cast to an integer. This can be done using the `::integer` operator. For example, if the value retrieved from the JSON object is stored in a column called `json_value`, the following query can be used:

```sql
SELECT json_value::integer AS int_value FROM table;
```

3. **Check for NULL Values**

If the JSON object contains a `null` value, it cannot be cast to an integer. To check for this condition, the `IS NOT NULL` operator can be used. For example, if the value retrieved from the JSON object is stored in a column called `json_value`, the following query can be used:

```sql
SELECT json_value::integer AS int_value FROM table WHERE json_value IS NOT NULL;
```

4. **Handle NULL Values**

If the JSON object contains a `null` value, it must be handled in some way before it can be cast to an integer. This can be done by using the `COALESCE` function to provide a default value if the value is `null`. For example, if the value retrieved from the JSON object is stored in a column called `json_value`, the following query can be used:

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(json_value::integer, 0) AS int_value FROM table;
```

The `COALESCE` function will return `0` if the value is `null`, or the value cast to an integer if it is not `null`.
