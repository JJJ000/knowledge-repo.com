## Size in Bytes

JSON objects are typically measured in bytes. The exact size of a JSON object depends on the size of the data it contains. Generally speaking, a JSON object can range from a few bytes to several kilobytes or even megabytes in size.

## Size in KBs

JSON objects are typically measured in kilobytes (KBs). A JSON object of 1 KB in size is capable of storing around 1000 characters of data. A JSON object of 10 KB in size is capable of storing around 10,000 characters of data.

## Size in MBs

JSON objects are also typically measured in megabytes (MBs). A JSON object of 1 MB in size is capable of storing around 1 million characters of data. A JSON object of 10 MB in size is capable of storing around 10 million characters of data.

## Summary

The size of a JSON object can range from a few bytes to several kilobytes or even megabytes in size, depending on the amount of data it contains. A JSON object of 1 KB in size is capable of storing around 1000 characters of data, while a JSON object of 1 MB in size is capable of storing around 1 million characters of data.
