**Section 1: What is JSON?**

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is a text-based, human-readable format for representing simple data structures and associative arrays (called objects).

**Section 2: What is a Syntax Error?**

A syntax error is an error in the syntax of a sequence of characters or tokens that is intended to be written in a particular programming language. It indicates that the sequence of characters or tokens is not valid in that language and, therefore, cannot be parsed.

**Section 3: What is a JSON Parsing Error?**

A JSON parsing error occurs when a JSON string is not properly formatted, or when a character is encountered that is not valid in the JSON syntax. This type of error can occur when the data being parsed is not valid JSON, or when the data is not properly formatted.

**Section 4: How to Resolve a JSON Parsing Error?**

To resolve a JSON parsing error, you should first check the syntax of the JSON string and make sure it is valid. If the syntax is valid, then you should check the data itself to make sure it is properly formatted. If the data is not properly formatted, you should modify it so that it is valid.
