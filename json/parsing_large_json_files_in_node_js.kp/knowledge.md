tldr: Node.js provides an efficient way to parse large JSON files by using the JSON.parse() method.

[TOC]

## Section 1: Using `fs.readFile`

The `fs.readFile` method can be used to read a large JSON file in Node.js. This method takes the path of the file as an argument and returns a Buffer object containing the contents of the file. The contents of the file can then be parsed using the `JSON.parse()` method.

## Section 2: Using `fs.readFileSync`

The `fs.readFileSync` method can also be used to read a large JSON file in Node.js. This method is similar to `fs.readFile`, except that it is synchronous and blocks the execution of the code until the file is read. The contents of the file can then be parsed using the `JSON.parse()` method.

## Section 3: Using `streams`

Another approach to reading a large JSON file in Node.js is to use streams. Streams allow for the file to be read in chunks, which can be more efficient than reading the entire file at once. The `fs.createReadStream` method can be used to create a readable stream, and the `JSON.parse` method can be used to parse the data as it is read.

## Section 4: Using `request`

Finally, the `request` module can be used to read a large JSON file from an external source. This module can be used to make HTTP requests and the response can be parsed using the `JSON.parse()` method.
