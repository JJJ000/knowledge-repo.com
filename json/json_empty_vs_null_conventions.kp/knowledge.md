## Empty

In JSON, empty values are represented by an empty string, i.e. `""`. This is typically used when a value is expected, but there is no data to provide.

## Null

In JSON, null is represented by the keyword `null`. This is typically used when there is no value associated with a particular key. It indicates that the key is present, but has no associated value.
