# Section 1: Writing a JSON Deserializer in Spring

The first step to writing a JSON deserializer in Spring is to create a class that implements the Spring `JsonDeserializer` interface. This class should be annotated with the `@Component` annotation to make it available for use in other components. The class should also define a `deserialize()` method that takes a `JsonParser` object and a `DeserializationContext` object as parameters. This method should parse the JSON data and return an object of the desired type.

# Section 2: Extending the JsonDeserializer

The `JsonDeserializer` interface provides several methods that can be overridden to customize the JSON deserialization process. For example, the `isCachable()` method can be overridden to determine whether the deserialized object should be cached or not. The `createInstance()` method can be overridden to create an instance of the desired type from the JSON data. The `deserialize()` method can be overridden to define how the JSON data should be deserialized.

# Section 3: Registering the Deserializer

Once the custom deserializer has been written, it must be registered with the Spring application context in order to be used. This can be done by adding the `@JsonDeserialize` annotation to the class definition. This annotation takes a `using` parameter which should be set to the fully qualified name of the custom deserializer class.

# Section 4: Using the Deserializer

Once the custom deserializer has been registered, it can be used in any component that needs to deserialize JSON data. The deserializer can be used by injecting it into the component and then calling its `deserialize()` method with the appropriate parameters. The deserialized object can then be used as needed.
