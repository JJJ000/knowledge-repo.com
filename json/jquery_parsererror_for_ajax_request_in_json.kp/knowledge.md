**Section 1: Overview**

jQuery is a popular JavaScript library used to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. When making an AJAX request, it is possible for jQuery to return a "parsererror" response. This indicates that the response from the server was not in the expected format, and jQuery was unable to parse it correctly.

**Section 2: Causes**

The "parsererror" response is typically caused by an incorrect MIME type being returned from the server. The MIME type should be "application/json" for a JSON response, or "text/xml" for an XML response. If the wrong MIME type is returned, jQuery will not be able to parse the response correctly, and will return a "parsererror" response instead.

Another possible cause is an incorrect response format. The response should be in the expected format (JSON or XML) and should be correctly formatted. If the response is not in the correct format, jQuery will not be able to parse it correctly, and will return a "parsererror" response instead.

**Section 3: Solutions**

The first step in resolving a "parsererror" response is to check the MIME type being returned from the server. The MIME type should be "application/json" for a JSON response, or "text/xml" for an XML response. If the wrong MIME type is returned, it should be corrected to the correct MIME type.

The second step is to check the response format. The response should be in the expected format (JSON or XML) and should be correctly formatted. If the response is not in the correct format, it should be corrected to the correct format.

**Section 4: Conclusion**

If jQuery is returning a "parsererror" response for an AJAX request, it is likely due to an incorrect MIME type or incorrect response format. The MIME type should be "application/json" for a JSON response, or "text/xml" for an XML response. The response should also be in the expected format (JSON or XML) and should be correctly formatted. If these issues are corrected, the "parsererror" response should be resolved.
