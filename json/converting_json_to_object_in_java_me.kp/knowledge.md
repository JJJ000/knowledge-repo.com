**Section 1: Introduction**

Java ME is a platform that enables developers to create applications for mobile and embedded devices. It is based on the Java language and provides a wide range of APIs and libraries that allow developers to create powerful and efficient applications. One of the key features of Java ME is its ability to convert a JSON string to an object. This tutorial will explain how to do this in Java ME.

**Section 2: Installing the JSON Libraries**

In order to convert a JSON string to an object in Java ME, you will need to install the JSON libraries for Java ME. These libraries can be found on the Oracle website. Once you have downloaded the libraries, you will need to add them to your Java ME project.

**Section 3: Converting the JSON String**

Once the JSON libraries have been installed, you can begin the process of converting the JSON string to an object. To do this, you will need to use the JSONObject class. This class provides methods for parsing a JSON string and creating a new object from it.

**Section 4: Using the JSON Object**

Once the JSON string has been converted to an object, you can use the JSONObject class to access and manipulate the data stored in the object. The JSONObject class provides methods for getting and setting values, as well as methods for iterating over the object's properties. You can use these methods to access and manipulate the data stored in the JSON object.
