## Section 1: Overview
A TypeError: path must be absolute or specify root to res.sendFile error is thrown when attempting to send a file using the Node.js response object's sendFile() method. This error occurs because the sendFile() method requires an absolute path or a path with a root directory specified in order to send the file.

## Section 2: Causes
The most common cause of this error is attempting to send a file with a relative path instead of an absolute path or a path with a root directory specified. This can occur when the file path is not specified correctly or if the file is moved to a different location.

## Section 3: Solutions
The best way to resolve this error is to make sure that the file path is specified correctly and that the file is in the correct location. If the file is moved to a different location, it is necessary to update the file path accordingly. Additionally, it is possible to specify a root directory when using the sendFile() method, which can be used to ensure that the correct file is being sent.
