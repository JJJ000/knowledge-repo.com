### Unexpected Character

An unexpected character refers to any character that does not conform to the syntax of the JSON data format. This can include any character that is not a valid JSON value, such as a comma, colon, quote, or other special character.

### Causes

Unexpected characters can be caused by a variety of factors, such as typos, incorrectly formatted data, or errors in the source code.

### Solutions

The best way to address unexpected characters is to review the code and data to ensure that they are properly formatted. If the source code is correct, then the data should be checked for any typos or incorrect formatting. Once the issue has been identified and corrected, the JSON data should be parsed again.
