tldr: Two JSON objects with the same elements in a different order can be compared for equality by stringifying the objects and comparing the strings.

# Section 1: Sort the JSON Objects

The first step in comparing two JSON objects with the same elements in a different order is to sort the objects. This ensures that the elements are in the same order for both objects, which makes it easier to compare them.

# Section 2: Compare the Elements

Once the objects are sorted, the next step is to compare the elements. This can be done by looping through each object and comparing the elements one-by-one. If all of the elements match, then the objects are equal.

# Section 3: Use a Library

Alternatively, a library can be used to compare the objects. There are several libraries available that provide functions to compare JSON objects. These libraries can simplify the process of comparing objects and make it easier to identify differences.

# Section 4: Use a Hash Table

Another approach is to use a hash table to compare the two objects. A hash table is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. By creating a hash table for each object, it is possible to compare the two objects by comparing the keys and values. If all of the keys and values match, then the objects are equal.
