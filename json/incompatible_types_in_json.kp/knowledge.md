Intrinsic attributes are attributes that are built-in to the language and are not user-defined. In the case of JSON, this includes the basic data types such as strings, numbers, and booleans, as well as the array and object data structures. Therefore, any type that can be represented as one of these basic data types or data structures is assignable to an Intrinsic attribute in JSON.

**Section 2: Intrinsic Class Attributes**

Intrinsic class attributes are attributes that are specific to a particular class. In the case of JSON, this includes the data types that are specific to the JSON language, such as the JSON object, JSON array, and JSON string. Therefore, any type that can be represented as one of these specific data types is assignable to an Intrinsic class attribute in JSON.

**Section 3: Type '{}'**

The type '{}' is a JSON object. Therefore, it is assignable to an Intrinsic class attribute in JSON.

**Section 4: Conclusion**

In conclusion, type '{}' is assignable to an Intrinsic attribute and an Intrinsic class attribute in JSON.
