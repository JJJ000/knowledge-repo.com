## Check File Path

The first step to troubleshoot why a json file is not found is to check the file path. Make sure that the file is in the correct directory and that the path is correct. If the file is not in the correct directory, move it there. If the path is incorrect, update it to the correct one.

## Check File Extension

Another step to troubleshoot why a json file is not found is to check the file extension. Make sure that the file is saved as a .json file. If it is not, save the file as a .json file.

## Check File Content

It is also important to check the content of the json file to make sure that it is valid json. If the json is not valid, it will not be read correctly. Use a json validator to check the content of the file.

## Check Access Permissions

Finally, check the access permissions of the file. Make sure that the user has the correct permissions to access the file. If not, update the permissions to allow read access.
