#What is a JSON ValueError?
A JSON ValueError is an error that occurs when the syntax of a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) file is incorrect.

#What is the Meaning of 'Expecting Property Name'?
This means that the JSON parser encountered an unexpected character instead of a property name. Property names are strings that are used to identify values in a JSON object.

#What is the Meaning of 'Line 1 Column 2 (Char 1)'?
This is the location of the unexpected character in the JSON file. The line number is 1, the column number is 2, and the character number is 1.

#How Can This Error Be Resolved?
The unexpected character can be removed or replaced with the appropriate property name. It is important to check the syntax of the JSON file to make sure it is valid before attempting to use it.
