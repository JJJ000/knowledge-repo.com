# Section 1: What is JSON?
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is a text-based, human-readable format for representing simple data structures and associative arrays (called objects).

# Section 2: What are Python Tuples?
Python tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the enumerate() built-in). Tuples are also used for cases where an immutable sequence of homogeneous data is needed (such as allowing storage in a set or dict instance).

# Section 3: Preserving Python Tuples with JSON
Python tuples can be preserved with JSON by using the JSON array syntax. This involves enclosing the tuple elements in square brackets, with each element separated by a comma. For example, a tuple containing strings 'a' and 'b' would be represented as ["a", "b"].
