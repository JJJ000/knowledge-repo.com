## Section 1: Understanding JsonProcessingException

JsonProcessingException is a type of exception thrown by the Jackson library when it is unable to process a JSON string. It is an unchecked exception and is a subclass of the Java RuntimeException class.

## Section 2: Causes of JsonProcessingException

JsonProcessingException can be caused by a variety of issues, such as invalid JSON syntax, missing values, or invalid data types. Additionally, it can be thrown if the Jackson library is unable to parse the JSON string.

## Section 3: Example of JsonProcessingException

The following example shows how to throw a JsonProcessingException when the JSON string is invalid:

```
try {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
    mapper.readValue("invalid json string", Object.class);
} catch (JsonProcessingException e) {
    throw new JsonProcessingException("Error parsing JSON string", e);
}
```

## Section 4: Preventing JsonProcessingException

It is important to ensure that the JSON string is valid before attempting to parse it. Additionally, it is important to check for missing values and invalid data types. If any of these issues are present, they should be addressed before attempting to parse the JSON string.
