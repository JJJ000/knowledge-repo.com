1. Encode the JSON String
--------------------------------
The first step to escape a JSON string to have it in a URL is to encode it. This can be done using an online tool or a library such as json_encode(). This will convert the JSON string into a URL-safe string.

2. URL-Encode the Encoded String
--------------------------------
The next step is to URL-encode the encoded string. This can be done using an online tool or a library such as urlencode(). This will convert the encoded JSON string into a URL-safe string.

3. Add the Encoded String to the URL
------------------------------------
The final step is to add the encoded string to the URL. This can be done by simply appending the encoded string to the end of the URL.

4. Test the URL
----------------
Once the encoded string has been added to the URL, it is important to test the URL to ensure that it works correctly. This can be done by simply entering the URL into a browser and seeing if the expected results are returned.
