**Section 1: What is Retrofit2**

Retrofit2 is an open source library for Android which allows developers to easily connect to web services and handle API calls. It is an HTTP client library used for network communication and makes it easy to consume web services from within an Android application.

**Section 2: What is an Expected BEGIN_ARRAY but was BEGIN_OBJECT Error**

An Expected BEGIN_ARRAY but was BEGIN_OBJECT error occurs when the JSON structure received from a web service does not match the expected structure. This error typically occurs when the JSON structure received does not have an array as the root element, but rather an object.

**Section 3: How to Solve the Error**

The best way to solve this error is to check the JSON structure that is being received from the web service and make sure that it is structured correctly. If the JSON structure is incorrect, it will need to be changed in order to match the expected structure.

**Section 4: Conclusion**

The Expected BEGIN_ARRAY but was BEGIN_OBJECT error is a common error that can occur when working with Retrofit2 and web services. It can be solved by checking the JSON structure that is being received and making sure that it is structured correctly.
