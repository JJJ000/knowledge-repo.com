**1. What is JSON?**

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to exchange data between different applications. It is a text-based data format that is designed to be human-readable and easily parsed by computers.

**2. How to Preserve Order in JSON?**

JSON does not guarantee the order of elements within an object. To preserve the order of elements within an object, the python module json.dumps() can be used. This method will serialize the object into a JSON string and preserve the order of elements.

**3. What is json.dumps()?**

json.dumps() is a method in the Python JSON module that serializes an object into a JSON string. It takes an object as an argument and returns a JSON string representation of the object.

**4. How to Use json.dumps() to Preserve Order in JSON?**

To use json.dumps() to preserve order in JSON, the object must first be serialized using the json.dumps() method. This will return a JSON string that preserves the order of elements within the object. The JSON string can then be used to create a JSON object with the desired order of elements.
