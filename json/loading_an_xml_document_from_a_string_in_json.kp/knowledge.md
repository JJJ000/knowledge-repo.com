## Overview
XmlDocument is an in-memory representation of an XML document. It provides a way to programmatically create, modify, and navigate an XML document. It enables developers to create, modify, and delete elements, attributes, and other nodes in an XML document.

The XmlDocument class is part of the System.Xml namespace in the .NET Framework. It is an important part of the .NET Framework's XML processing capabilities.

## Deserializing a Json String to XML
The first step to loading an XML document from a Json string is to deserialize the Json string into an XML document. This can be done using a library such as Newtonsoft.Json, which provides a JsonConvert class that can be used to deserialize a Json string into an XmlDocument object.

## Converting XML to XmlDocument
Once the Json string has been deserialized into an XML document, the next step is to convert the XML document into an XmlDocument object. This can be done using the XmlDocument.LoadXml() method, which takes an XML string and returns an XmlDocument object.

## Conclusion
Loading an XML document from a Json string requires two steps: deserializing the Json string into an XML document, and then converting the XML document into an XmlDocument object. This can be done using a library such as Newtonsoft.Json and the XmlDocument.LoadXml() method.
