# Section 1: Getting the JSON Object

The first step in getting a JSON object from a URL is to use the `fetch()` API. This API takes a URL as its first argument, and returns a promise that resolves to a Response object containing the response to the request.

# Section 2: Parsing the Response

Once the response is received, the next step is to parse the response into a JSON object. This can be done with the `json()` method, which returns a promise that resolves to a JavaScript object containing the JSON data.

# Section 3: Using the JSON Object

Once the JSON object is parsed, it can be used in the application. This could involve looping through the object and displaying the data, or manipulating the data in some way.

# Section 4: Error Handling

Finally, it is important to handle any errors that may occur when retrieving or parsing the JSON data. This can be done with a `catch()` statement, which will catch any errors that may occur and handle them appropriately.
