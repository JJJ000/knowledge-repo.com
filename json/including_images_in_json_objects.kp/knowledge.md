1. Preparing the Image File
- Before inserting an image file into a JSON object, it is important to prepare the image file by making sure it is in a supported format. The most common formats that are supported by JSON are JPEG, PNG, and GIF. Additionally, it is important to make sure the image file is of an appropriate size to be stored in a JSON object. 

2. Encoding the Image File
- Once the image file is prepared, the next step is to encode the image file into a Base64 string. Base64 is an encoding scheme that is used to represent binary data in an ASCII string format. This allows the image file to be stored in the JSON object as a string. 

3. Inserting the Encoded Image File into the JSON Object
- After the image file is encoded into a Base64 string, it can then be inserted into the JSON object. This can be done by creating a new key-value pair in the JSON object and setting the value to the Base64 string. 

4. Decoding the Image File
- Finally, the image file can be decoded from the Base64 string in order to be used. This can be done by using a Base64 decoding algorithm. Once the image file is decoded, it can then be used as normal.
