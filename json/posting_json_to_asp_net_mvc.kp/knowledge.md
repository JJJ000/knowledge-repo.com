[TOC]

## Section 1 - Overview

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used for exchanging data between a server and a client. It is primarily used for web applications and is commonly used to send and receive data from a server. In ASP.NET MVC, JSON data can be posted to an action method in a controller, which can then be used to perform various operations.

## Section 2 - Setup

In order to post JSON data to an ASP.NET MVC action method, the client must be able to send a valid JSON string to the server. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as using the jQuery library to send an AJAX request. Additionally, the server must be configured to accept JSON data. This can be done by setting the content type of the request to "application/json".

## Section 3 - Posting Data

Once the client and server are setup to send and receive JSON data, the actual data can be posted to an action method. This can be done by using the HttpPost attribute on the action method and passing the JSON data as a parameter. The JSON data can then be parsed and used to perform various operations.

## Section 4 - Conclusion

Posting JSON data to an ASP.NET MVC action method is a straightforward process. By setting up the client and server correctly, data can be posted and processed on the server. This can be used to create powerful web applications that can process and respond to data from a client.
