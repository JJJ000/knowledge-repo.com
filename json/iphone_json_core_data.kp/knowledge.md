# Introduction
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and Core Data are two technologies used on the iPhone to store and manage data. JSON is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data, while Core Data is a framework used to manage an object graph of related data.

# JSON
JSON is a text-based data format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a lightweight format that is easy to read and write, and is often used in web applications and mobile applications. JSON is commonly used to store user data, such as preferences, settings, and data used to populate user interfaces.

# Core Data
Core Data is a framework used to manage an object graph of related data. It is used to store and retrieve data from a database or other data store. Core Data provides an object-oriented interface that makes it easy to work with data and provides a range of features such as object-relational mapping, validation, and undo/redo support.

# Comparison
JSON and Core Data are both used to store and manage data on the iPhone, but they are used for different purposes. JSON is used to store and exchange data, while Core Data is used to manage an object graph of related data. JSON is lightweight and easy to read and write, while Core Data provides an object-oriented interface and a range of features.
