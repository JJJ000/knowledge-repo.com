# Section 1 - Install Required Packages

The first step is to install the required packages. We will need the `xmljson` package to convert XML to JSON. To install it, run the following command:

```
pip install xmljson
```

# Section 2 - Import Packages

Once the packages are installed, we need to import them into our Python script. We will be importing the `xmljson` package to use its `badgerfish` function.

```
from xmljson import badgerfish as bf
```

# Section 3 - Read XML File

The next step is to read the XML file into our Python script. We can do this by using the `read()` function.

```
with open('my_xml_file.xml') as xml_file:
    data = xml_file.read()
```

# Section 4 - Convert XML to JSON

Finally, we can use the `badgerfish` function from the `xmljson` package to convert the XML data to JSON.

```
json_data = bf.data(data)
```
