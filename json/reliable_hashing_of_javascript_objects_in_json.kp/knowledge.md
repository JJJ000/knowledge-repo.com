# Section 1: Hashing with SHA-256

SHA-256 is a cryptographic hash function that is used to securely hash JavaScript objects in JSON. It is a one-way function, meaning that the output of the function cannot be reversed to obtain the original input. SHA-256 produces a 256-bit (32-byte) fixed-length output which is represented as a hexadecimal number.

# Section 2: Converting JSON to String

In order to hash a JavaScript object in JSON, it must first be converted to a string. This can be done using the `JSON.stringify()` method which takes a JavaScript object and returns a string representation of it.

# Section 3: Hashing the String

Once the JSON object has been converted to a string, it can then be hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm. This can be done using a library such as CryptoJS which provides a `SHA256()` function that takes a string as an argument and returns the SHA-256 hash of that string.

# Section 4: Verifying the Hash

Once the SHA-256 hash of the JSON object has been generated, it can be used to verify the integrity of the data. This can be done by hashing the original JSON object and comparing the two hashes. If they are the same, then the data has not been tampered with.
