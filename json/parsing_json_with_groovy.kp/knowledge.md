# Section 1: Setting Up

In order to parse JSON using Groovy, you must first set up your environment. This requires that you have Groovy installed on your system. You can download the latest version from the [Groovy website](http://groovy-lang.org/download.html). Once you have Groovy installed, you can begin to parse JSON.

# Section 2: Parsing JSON

Once you have Groovy installed, you can use the `JsonSlurper` class to parse JSON. To use the `JsonSlurper` class, you must first import it into your Groovy script. You can do this by using the `import` statement:

```groovy
import groovy.json.JsonSlurper
```

Once you have imported the `JsonSlurper` class, you can create a new instance of it. This instance will allow you to parse a JSON string:

```groovy
def jsonSlurper = new JsonSlurper()
```

# Section 3: Accessing Values

Once you have created an instance of the `JsonSlurper` class, you can use it to access values in the JSON string. To do this, you can use the `getProperty` method. This method takes a key as an argument and returns the value associated with that key:

```groovy
def value = jsonSlurper.getProperty('key')
```

# Section 4: Iterating Through Values

If you need to iterate through all the values in the JSON string, you can use the `each` method. This method takes a closure as an argument and executes that closure on each value in the JSON string:

```groovy
jsonSlurper.each { key, value ->
    // Do something with the key and value
}
```
