## Yes

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format and is used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection. Node.js has built-in support for JSON and can parse and stringify it out of the box.

## Advantages

JSON has become the de facto standard for data exchange on the web and Node.js makes it easy to parse and stringify it. It is also a language-independent data format, which makes it easier to share data between different languages and platforms.

## Disadvantages

JSON has some disadvantages, such as its lack of support for custom data types and its lack of support for comments. Additionally, it can be difficult to debug JSON errors due to its lack of support for line numbers.

## Conclusion

Overall, JSON is an important part of Node.js and is used for data exchange between the server and the client. It has both advantages and disadvantages, but is still widely used due to its ease of use and language-independent nature.
