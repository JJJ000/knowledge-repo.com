**Escaping Strings with Backslash**

1. When creating a string in JSON, you must escape certain characters such as quotation marks, backslashes, and line breaks. To do this, you can use the backslash character (\\). This will add a backslash before any of the characters listed above, thus allowing them to be used in the string without causing any errors. 

2. For example, if you wanted to add a quotation mark (“) to a string, you would need to escape it by adding a backslash before it. This would look like “\””.

**Encoding Strings with Unicode**

1. Another way to escape strings in JSON is to use Unicode encoding. Unicode is a standard for encoding characters, and it allows you to represent any character in any language. 

2. To use Unicode encoding, you need to know the Unicode code point for the character you want to add to the string. For example, the Unicode code point for a quotation mark is “U+0022”. To add this character to a string, you would need to add the following to the string: “\u0022”.

**Using JSON.stringify()**

1. Another way to escape strings in JSON is to use the JSON.stringify() method. This method will automatically escape any characters that need to be escaped, such as quotation marks, backslashes, and line breaks. 

2. To use this method, simply pass the string you want to escape as an argument to the JSON.stringify() method. For example, if you wanted to escape a string that contained a quotation mark, you would do the following: JSON.stringify("\""). This would return the escaped string “\””.
