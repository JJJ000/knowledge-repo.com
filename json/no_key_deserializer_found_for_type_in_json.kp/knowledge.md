tldr: No, there is no built-in deserializer for Maps in JSON.

**Section 1: Overview**

When deserializing JSON, a key deserializer is needed to map a JSON key to a corresponding Java object. This is especially important for complex objects such as Maps, where the key needs to be mapped to a type that can be used as a key in the Map. Unfortunately, when working with simple types such as classes, it can be difficult to find a key deserializer for them. 

**Section 2: Challenges**

The main challenge with finding a key deserializer for simple types is that the type may not have a natural mapping to a Java object. For example, a String may not have a corresponding Java object, so it can be difficult to find a key deserializer that can map the String to a suitable type. Additionally, if the type is a custom class, it can be difficult to find a key deserializer that can map the class to a suitable type. 

**Section 3: Solutions**

Fortunately, there are a few solutions to this problem. One solution is to use a custom deserializer that can map the simple type to a suitable Java object. This custom deserializer can then be used to map the simple type to the desired key type. Additionally, if the type is a custom class, it can be mapped to a suitable type using a custom key deserializer. 

**Section 4: Conclusion**

In conclusion, when deserializing JSON, it can be difficult to find a key deserializer for simple types such as classes. However, there are solutions to this problem, such as using a custom deserializer or a custom key deserializer. With these solutions, it is possible to map the simple type to a suitable Java object and use it as a key in the Map.
