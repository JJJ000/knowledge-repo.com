## Section 1: Check Connectivity

The first step to troubleshooting this issue is to check the connectivity between your machine and the schemastore.azurewebsites.net. To do this, you can use the ping command from the command line. If the ping command is successful, then you should be able to access the schemastore.azurewebsites.net.

## Section 2: Check Firewall

If the ping command was successful, then the next step is to check the firewall settings on your machine. If the firewall is blocking access to the schemastore.azurewebsites.net, then you will need to allow access to the domain in order to be able to access the schemastore.

## Section 3: Check Browser Settings

If the firewall settings are not the issue, then the next step is to check the browser settings. Make sure that the browser is not blocking access to the schemastore.azurewebsites.net. If the browser is blocking access, then you will need to allow access to the domain in order to be able to access the schemastore.

## Section 4: Check JSON Files

Finally, if all of the above steps have been completed and the issue still persists, then it is possible that there is an issue with the .json files themselves. Check the syntax of the .json files to make sure that they are valid and are correctly referencing the schemastore.azurewebsites.net. If the syntax is incorrect, then it can cause the .json files to not load correctly.
