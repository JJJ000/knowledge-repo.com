### Section 1: Overview

When attempting to parse a JSON response, it is possible to encounter an error indicating that a `com.google.gson.internal.LinkedTreeMap` cannot be cast to a specific class. This error occurs when the JSON response contains an object that cannot be converted into the specified class.

### Section 2: Causes

This error is caused by the fact that the JSON response contains a type of object that cannot be converted into the specified class. This can occur if the JSON response contains an object with a different structure than the specified class or if the JSON response contains an object with a different data type than the specified class.

### Section 3: Solutions

There are a few potential solutions that can be used to address this issue.

The first solution is to modify the specified class so that it has the same structure and data types as the object in the JSON response. This will allow the object to be properly converted into the specified class.

The second solution is to use a custom deserializer to convert the object in the JSON response into the specified class. This will allow the object to be properly converted into the specified class without having to modify the specified class.

### Section 4: Conclusion

When attempting to parse a JSON response, it is possible to encounter an error indicating that a `com.google.gson.internal.LinkedTreeMap` cannot be cast to a specific class. This error occurs when the JSON response contains an object that cannot be converted into the specified class. There are a few potential solutions that can be used to address this issue, such as modifying the specified class or using a custom deserializer.
