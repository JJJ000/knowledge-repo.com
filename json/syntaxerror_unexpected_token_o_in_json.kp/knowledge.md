### What is JSON
JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language, and is easy for humans to read and write.

### What is a SyntaxError
A SyntaxError is an error that occurs when the syntax of a program is incorrect. It means that the program does not conform to the rules of the programming language.

### What is an Unexpected Token
An Unexpected Token is an error that occurs when a program encounters an unexpected character in the code. In this case, the unexpected character is an "o".

### How to Resolve the Error
To resolve the error, you need to locate the source of the unexpected token and correct it. This can be done by checking the code for any typos or incorrect syntax. Once the error is fixed, the program should run without issue.
