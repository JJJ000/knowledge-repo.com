[TOC]

**Section 1: Parsing the JSON Stream**

The first step in processing a continuous stream of JSON is to parse the data. This can be done using a library such as Jackson or Gson, or by writing custom code to parse the data. The library or code should be able to handle data that is received in chunks and parse it into valid JSON objects.

**Section 2: Processing the JSON**

Once the JSON stream has been parsed, it can be processed. This can be done using a library such as Jackson or Gson, or by writing custom code to process the data. The code should be able to handle data that is received in chunks and process it into the appropriate data structures.

**Section 3: Storing the Data**

Once the JSON stream has been processed, the data needs to be stored. This can be done using a database such as MongoDB or MySQL, or by writing custom code to store the data. The code should be able to handle data that is received in chunks and store it in the appropriate data structures.

**Section 4: Outputting the Data**

Once the data has been stored, it can be outputted. This can be done using a library such as Jackson or Gson, or by writing custom code to output the data. The code should be able to handle data that is received in chunks and output it in the appropriate format.
