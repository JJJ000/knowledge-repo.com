**Section 1: Retrieve the JSON Tree**

To begin, you need to retrieve the JSON tree from the server. This can be done using jQuery's `$.getJSON()` method, which will return the tree as a JavaScript object.

**Section 2: Traverse the Tree**

Once you have the tree, you can traverse it using jQuery's `$.each()` method. This method will loop through each node of the tree, allowing you to check the values of each node.

**Section 3: Check the Values**

Once you have looped through each node of the tree, you can check the values of each node to see if it matches your search criteria. If the value matches, you can store the node in a variable for later use.

**Section 4: Use the Results**

Once you have stored the nodes that match your search criteria, you can use them however you need. For example, you could use the nodes to update a page or send the data to another server.
