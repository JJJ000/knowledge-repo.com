1. Serializing the Model Object

To get a JSON object from a Razor Model object in JavaScript, the first step is to serialize the Model object. This can be done using the `JsonConvert.SerializeObject()` method from the Newtonsoft.Json library.

2. Passing the Serialized Object to JavaScript

Once the Model object is serialized, it must be passed to JavaScript. This can be done by passing the serialized object as a parameter to the JavaScript function. Alternatively, the serialized object can be written directly to the HTML page using the `<script>` tag.

3. Parsing the Serialized Object

Once the serialized object is passed to JavaScript, it must be parsed using the `JSON.parse()` method. This will convert the serialized object into a JavaScript object that can be used in the code.

4. Using the JavaScript Object

Finally, the JavaScript object can be used in the code. This can be done by accessing the properties of the object, or by passing the object as a parameter to other functions.
