1. Overview
-------
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format which is easy to read and write. It is commonly used for data exchange between web applications and mobile applications. JSON is a text format that is language independent and can be used in Android applications to communicate with other applications.

2. How to Convert an Object to JSON
-------
In Android, the process of converting an object to JSON is relatively simple. To convert an object to JSON, the object must first be serialized. This is done by using the Gson library, which is part of the Google Play Services.

3. Example
-------
Here is an example of how to use the Gson library to convert an object to JSON.

```
// Create a Gson instance 
Gson gson = new Gson(); 

// Create an object to be converted 
MyObject myObject = new MyObject(); 

// Convert the object to JSON 
String json = gson.toJson(myObject); 
```

4. Conclusion
-------
Converting an object to JSON in Android is a relatively simple process. It involves using the Gson library to serialize the object and then converting it to a JSON string. This process can be used to exchange data between web applications and mobile applications.
