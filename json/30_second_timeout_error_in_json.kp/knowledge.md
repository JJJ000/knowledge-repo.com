# Section 1: Overview

A fatal error occurs when a script takes longer to execute than the maximum allowed time. This is referred to as the "maximum execution time". When a script exceeds the maximum execution time, it will produce a fatal error, which can be seen as a "maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded" error when using JSON.

# Section 2: Causes

The main cause of this error is usually due to a script that is too complex or is attempting to process too much data. This can happen when a script is attempting to parse a large JSON file or when it is attempting to process a large amount of data.

# Section 3: Solutions

There are a few solutions to this error. The first is to increase the maximum execution time. This can be done by editing the php.ini file and increasing the max_execution_time parameter.

The second solution is to optimize the script to reduce the amount of data it needs to process. This can be done by reducing the complexity of the script, or by breaking the script up into smaller chunks that can be processed more quickly.

# Section 4: Conclusion

The "maximum execution time of 30 seconds exceeded" error is a common error when using JSON. The main cause of this error is usually due to a script that is too complex or is attempting to process too much data. To fix this error, it is recommended to increase the maximum execution time or to optimize the script to reduce the amount of data it needs to process.
