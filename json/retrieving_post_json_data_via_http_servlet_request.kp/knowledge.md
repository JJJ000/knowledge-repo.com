1. Parsing the Request Body 

The request body can be parsed by using the getReader() method of the HttpServletRequest class. This method returns a BufferedReader object which can be used to read the body of the request. The readLine() method of the BufferedReader can be used to get the JSON data from the request body.

2. Converting the JSON String to an Object 

Once the JSON data is obtained from the request body, it can be converted to an object by using the readValue() method of the ObjectMapper class. This method takes the JSON string and the class type of the object to which the JSON data needs to be converted as parameters and returns an object of the specified type.

3. Accessing the Object Data 

Once the JSON data is converted to an object, the data can be accessed by using the getter methods of the object. This allows the application to access the data in the JSON object and use it for further processing.

4. Error Handling 

Error handling should be done to make sure that the application gracefully handles any errors that might occur while parsing the request body or converting the JSON string to an object. This can be done by using the try-catch block and logging the errors in the application logs.
