# Section 1: Overview
Spring MVC Multipart Requests are used to send files as part of a request. They are commonly used for file uploads and other forms of data that need to be sent in a request. Multipart Requests can also be used to send JSON data as part of the request body.

# Section 2: Multipart Request
A Multipart Request is a HTTP request that contains multiple parts, each of which can contain different types of data. The parts are separated by a boundary, which is a string of characters that is used to identify the start and end of each part.

# Section 3: JSON Data
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to send data between the client and server. It is a text-based format that is easy to read and write.

# Section 4: Multipart Request with JSON
When sending a Multipart Request with JSON data, the JSON data is sent as one of the parts of the request. The JSON data should be encoded as a string, and the boundary string should be included in the Content-Type header. The Content-Type header should also specify the type of data that is being sent, such as application/json.
