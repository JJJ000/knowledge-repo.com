##### Section 1: Obtaining the JSON String

The first step in parsing a JSON response from an HTTP response is to obtain the JSON string from the response. This can be done by calling the `getEntity()` method on the response object. This will return an `HttpEntity` object, which can be used to obtain the JSON string.

##### Section 2: Parsing the JSON String

Once the JSON string has been obtained, it must be parsed in order to access its contents. This can be done using the `JSONObject` class from the org.json library. This class provides methods for parsing the JSON string and accessing its contents.

##### Section 3: Accessing the Contents of the JSON Object

Once the JSON string has been parsed, the contents of the JSON object can be accessed using the `get()` method. This method takes a string as a parameter, which is the key of the value that is being accessed.

##### Section 4: Working with the Result

Once the value has been accessed, it can be used in whatever way is necessary. This could be storing it in a variable, printing it to the console, or using it in some other way.
