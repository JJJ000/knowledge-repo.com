# Section 1: Initialization

Before rendering JSON in a controller, you must initialize the JSON object. This can be done by creating a new instance of the JSONObject class and then adding the necessary data to it.

# Section 2: Adding Data

Once you have initialized the JSONObject, you can start adding data to it. This can be done by using the put() method and passing in the key and value for the data.

# Section 3: Rendering

Once the JSONObject has been populated with the necessary data, you can render it in the controller. This can be done by using the render() method and passing in the JSONObject as the parameter.

# Section 4: Response

Finally, the controller can return the JSONObject as a response to the client. This can be done by using the response() method and passing in the JSONObject as the parameter.
