[TOC]

**Section 1: Defining a Collection**

A Backbone.js Collection is an ordered set of Model subclasses that can be used to manage and persist data. It provides an interface for adding, removing, and sorting Models, and can be used to synchronize data with a server.

**Section 2: Creating a Collection**

To create a Collection, you must first define the Model subclass that will form the basis of the Collection. This can be done by extending the Backbone.Model class. Once the Model subclass is defined, the Collection can be created by extending the Backbone.Collection class and passing in the Model subclass as an argument.

**Section 3: Adding Models to a Collection**

Once the Collection is created, you can add Models to it by using the Collection's add() method. This method takes a Model or an array of Models as an argument and adds them to the Collection.

**Section 4: Retrieving Models from a Collection**

You can retrieve Models from a Collection by using the Collection's get() method. This method takes the Model's id as an argument and returns the corresponding Model. You can also use the Collection's find() method to retrieve Models that match a given criteria.
