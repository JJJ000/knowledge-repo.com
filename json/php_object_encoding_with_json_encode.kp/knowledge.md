# Section 1: What is json_encode()?
json_encode() is a PHP function used to convert PHP objects into JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) strings. It takes a single parameter, which is the object to be encoded. 

# Section 2: How Does json_encode() Work?
json_encode() works by taking the object and converting it into a JSON string. It does this by looping through the objectâ€™s properties and values and creating a JSON string that represents the object.

# Section 3: Benefits of json_encode()
Using json_encode() has many benefits. It is a quick and easy way to convert an object into a JSON string, which can then be used in a variety of different applications. It also eliminates the need to manually create a JSON string from an object.

# Section 4: Limitations of json_encode()
One of the main limitations of json_encode() is that it cannot encode certain types of data, such as resources and closures. Additionally, it cannot encode objects that contain circular references.
