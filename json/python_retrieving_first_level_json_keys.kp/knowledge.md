tldr: No, JSON can contain nested keys, allowing for multiple levels of keys.

1. Accessing Keys Directly: 
   Keys in the first level of a JSON object can be accessed directly using `Object.keys()` or `Object.getOwnPropertyNames()` methods.

2. Iterating Through Keys: 
   Iterating through the first level of a JSON object can be done using a `for...in` loop. This loop will iterate through all the keys and values of the object.

3. Using a Library: 
   There are several libraries available that can be used to access and iterate through the keys of a JSON object. These include `jQuery` and `Underscore.js`.

4. Parsing the JSON: 
   Parsing the JSON string can be done using a parser such as `JSON.parse()`. This will return a JavaScript object which can then be used to access the keys.
