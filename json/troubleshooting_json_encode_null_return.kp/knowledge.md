**Section 1: Reasons for json_encode Returning NULL**

1. The data being encoded is not valid JSON.
2. The data type of the value being encoded is not supported.
3. The data contains invalid characters.
4. The data contains a resource type that cannot be encoded.

**Section 2: Troubleshooting Steps**

1. Check the data being encoded to ensure that it is valid JSON.
2. Ensure that the data type of the value being encoded is supported by json_encode.
3. Check the data for any invalid characters.
4. Check the data for any resources that cannot be encoded.

**Section 3: Alternative Solutions**

1. Use a different encoding method, such as serialize or json_decode.
2. Use a third-party library, such as Jsonify, to encode the data.
