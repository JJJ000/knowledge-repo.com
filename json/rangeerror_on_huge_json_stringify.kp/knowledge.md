# Solution

## Overview
JSON.stringify is a method used to convert a JavaScript object into a JSON string. When attempting to convert a large object into a JSON string, a RangeError may be thrown due to the string length exceeding the maximum allowed length.

## Causes
The maximum string length is determined by the JavaScript engine. Different engines have different maximum lengths, but the maximum length is typically around 2^31-1 characters. If the resulting JSON string exceeds this length, a RangeError will be thrown.

## Solutions
There are a few solutions that can be used to avoid a RangeError. 

1. Break up the object into smaller chunks and stringify each chunk separately. 
2. Use an alternative data format such as XML or YAML.
3. Use a third-party library such as JSONStream to stream the data. 

## Conclusion
When attempting to stringify a large object, it is important to be aware of the maximum string length and the potential for a RangeError to be thrown. If the string length exceeds the maximum allowed length, one of the solutions above should be used to avoid the error.
