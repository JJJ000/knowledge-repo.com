[TOC]

**Section 1: Setting Up the Server**

1. Create a `net/http` server in your Go program.
2. Set the server's port and address.
3. Register a handler function to respond to requests.

**Section 2: Writing the Handler Function**

1. Create a `http.ResponseWriter` and `http.Request` as parameters to your handler function.
2. Create a `map` of strings to represent the data you want to return in your JSON response.
3. Use the `json.NewEncoder` function to encode the data into JSON.
4. Write the JSON response to the `http.ResponseWriter`.

**Section 3: Testing the Server**

1. Start the server and make a request to it using a tool such as curl.
2. Check the response to make sure it is in the correct format.

**Section 4: Error Handling**

1. Add logic to your handler function to handle any errors that may occur.
2. Check the `http.ResponseWriter` for errors after writing the response.
