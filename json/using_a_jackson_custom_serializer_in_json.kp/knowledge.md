## Step 1: Create Custom Serializer

Create a custom serializer class that extends the StdSerializer class from the Jackson library. This serializer should override the "serialize" method, which is responsible for serializing the object into a JSON string.

## Step 2: Register the Serializer

Register the custom serializer with the ObjectMapper. This is done by calling the "registerModule" method on the ObjectMapper, and passing in the SimpleModule instance that contains the custom serializer.

## Step 3: Use the Serializer

When serializing an object, use the ObjectMapper to serialize the object. The ObjectMapper will use the registered custom serializer to serialize the object into a JSON string.

## Step 4: Deserialize

When deserializing an object, use the ObjectMapper to deserialize the JSON string. The ObjectMapper will use the registered custom serializer to deserialize the JSON string into an object.
