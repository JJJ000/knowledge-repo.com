### Data Format

Application/json is a data format in which data is sent as a JSON object. Application/x-www-form-urlencoded is a data format in which data is sent as a series of key-value pairs.

### Data Size

Application/json is often used to send larger amounts of data than application/x-www-form-urlencoded, as it can contain more complex data structures.

### Security

Application/json is often considered to be more secure than application/x-www-form-urlencoded, as it is not easily readable by humans.

### Usage

Application/json is commonly used for API calls, while application/x-www-form-urlencoded is commonly used for HTML forms.
