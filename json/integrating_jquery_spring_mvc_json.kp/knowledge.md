tldr: By using Spring MVC`s @RequestBody annotation, JSON data can be deserialized into Java objects, allowing JQuery to communicate with the server.

#### Section 1: Overview

JQuery and Spring MVC @RequestBody are two popular web development technologies that allow developers to easily create dynamic web applications. JQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. Spring MVC @RequestBody is an annotation used to bind an HTTP request body to a method parameter in a controller. It is used to bind the request body to a java object, enabling the controller to access the data from the request body easily. When used together, JQuery and Spring MVC @RequestBody can be used to easily create dynamic web applications that use JSON for data exchange.

#### Section 2: Using JQuery and Spring MVC @RequestBody

Using JQuery and Spring MVC @RequestBody together is relatively straightforward. The first step is to create an HTML form that contains the necessary fields that are to be sent to the server. The form should use the POST method, and the data should be encoded as JSON. Once the form is created, the next step is to create a JavaScript function that will be called when the form is submitted. This function should use the JQuery ajax() method to send the data to the server. The ajax() method should specify the URL, HTTP method, and the data to be sent.

#### Section 3: Processing the Request

On the server side, a controller method should be created that is annotated with the @RequestBody annotation. This method will be called when the ajax() request is sent from the client. The @RequestBody annotation will bind the request body to a java object, enabling the controller to access the data from the request body easily. The controller method should then process the data and return a response.
