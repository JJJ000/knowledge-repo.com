tldr: It is possible to use the @JsonProperty annotation on both the field and its corresponding getter/setter, but it is not necessary to do so.

[TOC]

Yes, it is possible to annotate a field as well as its corresponding getter/setter method using the `@JsonProperty` annotation, but there are some important considerations to keep in mind. 

## Why use @JsonProperty?

Before delving into the answer to the question, it is worth noting why one might want to use `@JsonProperty`. This annotation is used to indicate the name of a JSON property that should be used when serializing or deserializing a Java object. By default, Jackson (the popular library used for JSON processing in Java) uses the name of the field as the name of the JSON property. However, there are often cases where the field name does not follow the naming conventions expected by other systems that will be interacting with the JSON representation of the data. In these cases, the `@JsonProperty` annotation provides a way to specify a different name for the JSON property.

## Annotating Only the Field

If you only annotate the field with `@JsonProperty`, then the name specified in the annotation will be used as the property name for both serialization and deserialization. Here is an example of how to annotate a field:

```
public class MyClass {
    @JsonProperty("customName")
    private String myField;
    // ...
}
```

In this case, the `"customName"` property will be used for both serialization and deserialization.

## Annotating Only the Getter/Setter

It is also possible to annotate only the getter or setter method for a field using `@JsonProperty`. Doing so will override the default behavior of using the field name as the property name for serialization/deserialization. Here is an example:

```
public class MyClass {
    private String myField;

    @JsonProperty("customName")
    public String getMyField() {
        return myField;
    }
    // ...
}
```

In this example, the `"customName"` property will be used when serializing `MyClass` instances, but the default property name (i.e., `"myField"`) will still be used for deserialization.

## Annotating Both Field and Getter/Setter

It is also possible to annotate both the field and the corresponding getter/setter method with `@JsonProperty`. In this case, the annotation on the field will be used for deserialization and the annotation on the getter/setter method will be used for serialization. Here is an example:

```
public class MyClass {
    @JsonProperty("customName")
    private String myField;

    @JsonProperty("customName")
    public String getMyField() {
        return myField;
    }
    
    public void setMyField(String newValue) {
        myField = newValue;
    }
}
```

In this example, the field will be deserialized using the `"customName"` JSON property, and the getter/setter will be used to serialize the field to the same property name. 

## Conclusion

In summary, `@JsonProperty` can be used to specify custom property names for Java fields when they are serialized/deserialized to JSON. It is possible to annotate only the field, only the getter/setter, or both with this annotation, depending on your specific use case.
