1. Introduction

Retrofit is a type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java. It makes it easy to consume web services, as it supports the parsing of JSON, XML, and other web service data formats. It also provides an easy way to access nested JSON objects.

2. Setting up Retrofit

To use Retrofit with GSON, you need to set up the following dependencies:

• Retrofit
• GSON
• OkHttp

You can then create an instance of Retrofit, passing in the URL of the web service you are accessing, as well as a GsonConverterFactory.

3. Parsing Nested JSON Objects

To parse a nested JSON object, you need to create a class that matches the structure of the JSON object. This class should include all the fields of the nested object, as well as a constructor and getter/setter methods.

Once the class is created, you can use the Retrofit instance to access the web service and parse the JSON. The GsonConverterFactory will automatically convert the JSON into the class you created, allowing you to access the nested object.

4. Conclusion

Using Retrofit with GSON makes it easy to access and parse nested JSON objects. By creating a class that matches the structure of the JSON object, you can easily access the data and use it in your application.
