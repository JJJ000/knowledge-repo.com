**Section 1: Overview**

The node name in a JSON tree can be used to identify the particular element in the tree structure. It is an important part of the JSON syntax and is used to provide a way to access specific data within the tree.

**Section 2: How to get the node name**

The node name in a JSON tree can be obtained by using the built-in JSON.stringify() method. This method will take a JavaScript object and convert it into a string representation of the object. The string representation will include the node name of each element in the tree.

**Section 3: Example**

For example, consider the following JSON tree:

```
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 42
}
```

Using the JSON.stringify() method, the string representation of this tree would be the following:

```
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 42
}
```

The node names in this string representation are "name" and "age".

**Section 4: Conclusion**

In conclusion, the node name in a JSON tree can be obtained by using the built-in JSON.stringify() method. This method will take a JavaScript object and convert it into a string representation of the object, which includes the node name of each element in the tree.
