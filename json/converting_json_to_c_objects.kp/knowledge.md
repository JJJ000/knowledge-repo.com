### Section 1: Deserializing JSON

Deserializing JSON can be done by using the `JsonConvert` class from the Newtonsoft.Json library. The `JsonConvert` class has a `DeserializeObject<T>` method which can be used to convert a JSON string into a custom C# object.

### Section 2: Creating the Custom C# Object

In order to deserialize the JSON string, a custom C# object needs to be created that matches the structure of the JSON object. The custom C# object should have the same properties and data types as the JSON object.

### Section 3: Deserializing the JSON String

Once the custom C# object is created, the `JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>` method can be used to deserialize the JSON string into the custom C# object. The method takes the JSON string as a parameter and the custom C# object as the generic type parameter.

### Section 4: Using the Custom C# Object

Once the JSON string is deserialized, the custom C# object can be used in the application. The properties of the custom C# object can be accessed and manipulated as needed.
