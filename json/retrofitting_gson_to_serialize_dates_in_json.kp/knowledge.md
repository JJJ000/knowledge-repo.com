1. Overview
----------------
Retrofit is a powerful HTTP client for Android and Java which makes it easy to consume JSON or XML data which is then serialized into Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs). One common use case for Retrofit is to serialize a JSON string into a Java.util.date object. This article will explain how to do this.

2. Setup
----------------
In order to use Retrofit to serialize a JSON string into a Java.util.date object, you will need to include the following dependencies in your project's build.gradle file:

```
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.6.2'
implementation 'com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.6.2'
```

3. Usage
----------------
Once the dependencies have been included, you can use Retrofit to serialize the JSON string into a Java.util.date object. To do this, you will need to create a Java class which contains the fields that the JSON string contains. For example, if the JSON string contains a “date” field, you will need to create a Java class which contains a “date” field of type java.util.date.

You will also need to create a Retrofit interface which contains the methods that will be used to perform the serialization. For example, if you are serializing a JSON string into a Java.util.date object, you will need to create a method which takes a JSON string as a parameter and returns a Java.util.date object.

Finally, you will need to create an instance of the Retrofit interface and use it to serialize the JSON string into a Java.util.date object.

4. Conclusion
----------------
Retrofit makes it easy to serialize a JSON string into a Java.util.date object. All you need to do is include the necessary dependencies, create a Java class which contains the fields that the JSON string contains, create a Retrofit interface which contains the methods that will be used to perform the serialization, and create an instance of the Retrofit interface and use it to serialize the JSON string into a Java.util.date object.
