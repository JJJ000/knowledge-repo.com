#Arguments
Arguments are the parameters that are passed into a function. They are typically provided as a list of values, separated by commas. This allows the function to use the values in the arguments to perform some kind of operation.

#Options Object
An options object is an object that contains a set of key-value pairs. These key-value pairs are used to pass in additional options to a function. The options object allows for more flexibility than arguments, as it can contain any number of key-value pairs, and the values can be of any type.

#Advantages of Arguments
Using arguments is a simple and straightforward way to pass in parameters to a function. This makes it easier to understand the code, as the parameters are clearly specified in the function call.

#Advantages of Options Object
Using an options object allows for more flexibility when passing in parameters. It also makes it easier to add additional parameters, as the object can be extended with additional key-value pairs. Additionally, the values of the parameters can be of any type, which can be useful for passing in more complex data structures.
