**Contents**

[TOC]

## Section 1: Create a JSON File

Create a JSON file in the assets folder of your Android project. This file can contain any data that you wish to display in your ListView.

## Section 2: Create a Model Class

Create a model class that corresponds to the structure of your JSON file. This model class will be used to store the data from the JSON file and will be used to bind the data to your ListView.

## Section 3: Parse the JSON File

Use a JSON parsing library such as Gson or Jackson to parse the JSON file and store the data in the model class.

## Section 4: Bind the Data to the ListView

Create an adapter for your ListView and bind the data from the model class to the ListView. You can use an ArrayAdapter or a custom adapter depending on your needs.
