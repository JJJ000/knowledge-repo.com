# Section 1: Accessing a Dictionary by Key in a Django Template

In a Django template, a dictionary can be accessed by key using the `{{ dict.key }}` syntax. This syntax will return the value associated with the given key in the dictionary.

# Section 2: Accessing a Dictionary in a Json File

In order to access a dictionary in a Json file, you must use the `json.loads()` method to convert the Json string into a Python dictionary. Once the Json string has been loaded into a Python dictionary, the `dict[key]` syntax can be used to access individual values in the dictionary.

# Section 3: Example of Accessing a Dictionary by Key

Below is an example of accessing a dictionary by key in a Django template using a Json file:

```
# Load the Json file into a Python dictionary
import json
with open('data.json') as json_file:
    data = json.loads(json_file.read())

# Access the dictionary in the Django template
{{ data['key'] }}
```

# Section 4: Conclusion

In conclusion, accessing a dictionary by key in a Django template using a Json file can be done by first loading the Json file into a Python dictionary and then using the `{{ dict.key }}` syntax in the Django template to access the value associated with the given key.
