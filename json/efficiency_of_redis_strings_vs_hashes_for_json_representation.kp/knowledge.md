## Redis Strings
Redis strings are the most basic type of data structure in Redis. They are a sequence of bytes, which can be used to store any type of data, including JSON. They are lightweight and efficient, as they require minimal memory and processing power to store and access.

## Redis Hashes
Redis hashes are maps of key-value pairs, which can be used to store and access JSON data. They are more powerful than strings, as they can store multiple fields of data in a single structure. They are also more efficient than strings, as they require less memory to store and access the same amount of data.

## Efficiency in JSON
When it comes to efficiency in JSON, Redis hashes are more efficient than strings. This is because hashes can store multiple fields of data in a single structure, which reduces the amount of memory needed to store and access the same amount of data. Additionally, hashes can be indexed, which allows for faster access times than strings.
