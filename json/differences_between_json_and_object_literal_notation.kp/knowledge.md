### JSON
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is used to store and exchange data. It is a text-based, human-readable format that is used to transmit data objects consisting of attribute-value pairs and array data types. JSON is also a language-independent format, meaning that it can be used with any programming language.

### Object Literal Notation
Object Literal Notation (OLN) is a notation used to represent JavaScript objects. It is a subset of the JavaScript language and is used to represent objects in a more concise way. OLN is a way of representing an object in JavaScript without having to use the object constructor. It is a simple, easy to read notation that allows for quick object creation. OLN also allows for the creation of nested objects, which is not possible with JSON.
