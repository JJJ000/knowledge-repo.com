**Contents**

[TOC]

**Section 1: Import the JSON Library**

In order to serialize an object to JSON, you must first import the JSON library:

```python
import json
```

**Section 2: Create the Object**

Next, you must create the object that you want to serialize:

```python
my_object = {
    "name": "John Doe",
    "age": 42
}
```

**Section 3: Serialize the Object**

Once you have your object, you can serialize it to JSON using the `dumps` method:

```python
json_string = json.dumps(my_object)
```

**Section 4: Output the JSON String**

Finally, you can output the JSON string to the console or a file:

```python
print(json_string)
# Outputs: {"name": "John Doe", "age": 42}
```
