**Section 1: Declaring JSON Fields**

Declaring JSON fields is done by using the “@JsonProperty” annotation. This annotation can be used to declare a field as a JSON field, which will be included in the JSON output when the object is serialized.

**Section 2: Specifying the Name of the Field**

The “@JsonProperty” annotation can also be used to specify the name of the field when it is serialized. This is done by using the “name” attribute of the annotation. For example, if a field is declared as “@JsonProperty(name = “myField”)”, then the JSON output will contain a field named “myField”.

**Section 3: Specifying the Data Type of the Field**

The “@JsonProperty” annotation can also be used to specify the data type of the field when it is serialized. This is done by using the “type” attribute of the annotation. For example, if a field is declared as “@JsonProperty(type = String.class)”, then the JSON output will contain a field of type String.

**Section 4: Specifying the Format of the Field**

The “@JsonProperty” annotation can also be used to specify the format of the field when it is serialized. This is done by using the “format” attribute of the annotation. For example, if a field is declared as “@JsonProperty(format = “yyyy-MM-dd”)”, then the JSON output will contain a field with a date format of “yyyy-MM-dd”.
