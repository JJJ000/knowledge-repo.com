#Yes

JSON lists are ordered collections of values. The order of elements in a JSON list is preserved, meaning that the elements in the list will appear in the same order as they were entered. This is because JSON is a structured data format and the order of elements is an important part of the structure.

#No

JSON does not guarantee the order of elements in a list. This is because the order of elements in a JSON list is not part of the JSON specification. Therefore, different JSON parsers may parse the same JSON list in different orders.
