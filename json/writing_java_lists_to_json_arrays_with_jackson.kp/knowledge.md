tldr: The best way to write a Java List to a JSON array is to use a JSON library such as Gson or Jackson to serialize the List into a JSON string.

# Section 1: Installing Libraries

In order to write a Java list to a JSON array, it is necessary to install the appropriate libraries. The most popular library for this purpose is the Jackson library, which can be installed with the following command:

```
$ mvn install jackson
```

# Section 2: Creating a JSON Array

Once the library is installed, it is necessary to create a JSON array in Java. This can be done by creating a Java List object and adding the appropriate elements to it. For example, the following code creates a list of strings and adds them to a JSON array:

```
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("foo");
list.add("bar");

ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
JsonNode root = mapper.valueToTree(list);
```

# Section 3: Writing the JSON Array to a File

Once the JSON array is created, it can be written to a file using the ObjectMapper class. For example, the following code writes the JSON array to a file named “myfile.json”:

```
mapper.writeValue(new File("myfile.json"), root);
```

# Section 4: Validating the Output

Finally, it is important to validate the output of the JSON array to ensure that it is valid. This can be done by using a JSON validator, such as the JSONLint tool. The validator will check the syntax of the JSON array and report any errors.
