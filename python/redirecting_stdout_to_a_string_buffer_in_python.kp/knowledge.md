Yes, you can redirect the stdout into a string buffer in Python. There are several ways to accomplish this, depending on your specific needs and requirements. 

### Using StringIO 

One common way to redirect stdout to a string buffer is to use the `StringIO` module. This module provides an in-memory buffer that can be treated like a file object, allowing you to write output to it as if you were writing to a regular file. Here's a simple example:

```
from io import StringIO
import sys

# Create a StringIO buffer
buf = StringIO()

# Redirect stdout to the buffer
sys.stdout = buf

# Write some output
print("Hello, world!")

# Reset stdout to its original value
sys.stdout = sys.__stdout__

# Get the contents of the buffer as a string
output = buf.getvalue()

# Print the output
print(output)
```

In this example, we create a `StringIO` buffer, redirect stdout to the buffer, write some output to stdout, and then reset stdout to its original value. Finally, we retrieve the contents of the buffer as a string and print it out. The output should be "Hello, world!".


### Using contextlib.redirect_stdout 

Another way to redirect stdout to a string buffer is to use the `redirect_stdout` function from the `contextlib` module. This function allows you to redirect stdout to a context manager, which can be any object that supports the `write` method. Here's an example:

```
from contextlib import redirect_stdout
import io

# Create a BytesIO buffer
buf = io.BytesIO()

# Redirect stdout to the buffer
with redirect_stdout(buf):
    # Write some output
    print("Hello, world!")

# Get the contents of the buffer as a string
output = buf.getvalue().decode('utf-8')

# Print the output
print(output)
```

In this example, we create a `BytesIO` buffer, redirect stdout to the buffer using the `redirect_stdout` context manager, write some output to stdout, and then exit the context manager to reset stdout to its original value. Finally, we retrieve the contents of the buffer as a string and print it out. The output should be "Hello, world!".


### Using subprocess.check_output 

A third way to redirect stdout to a string buffer is to use the `subprocess.check_output` function. This function allows you to run a command in a subprocess and capture its output, including any output to stdout. Here's an example:

```
import subprocess

# Run a command that writes to stdout
output = subprocess.check_output(["echo", "Hello, world!"])

# Decode the output from bytes to a string
output = output.decode('utf-8')

# Print the output
print(output)
```

In this example, we use the `subprocess.check_output` function to run the `echo` command and capture its output, including any output to stdout. We then decode the output from bytes to a string and print it out. The output should be "Hello, world!". Note that this method is designed for running external commands, so it may not be appropriate for all use cases. 

### Using logging.basicConfig 

A way to redirect the the stdout into a log string is to use the logging module. You configure the root logger to write on a handler that sends everything (debug level and higher) to a buffer. Here's an example:

```
import io
import logging

log_stream = io.StringIO()

logging.basicConfig(stream=log_stream, level=logging.DEBUG)

logging.info("foo")

print(log_stream.getvalue())
```

With this in place, any calls to logging methods (debug, info, warning, error, critical) will go to the log_stream buffer. Finally, the last line show the buffer content when you run the code. The output should be "INFO:root:foo\n".


Note: It is important to reset stdout to its original value when you are done redirecting it. If you do not do this, any subsequent calls to print or other functions that write to stdout may behave unexpectedly.
