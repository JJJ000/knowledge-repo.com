tldr: Some float < integer comparisons are slower in Python because Python has to convert the integer to a float before performing the comparison, which is relatively more time-consuming than simply comparing two integers.

## Introduction

In Python, comparing two numbers, whether they are integers or floats, is a common operation. However, not all float < integer comparisons are equally fast. In fact, some comparisons can be up to four times slower than others, which can have a significant impact on the performance of a program. 

In this article, we will explore why some float < integer comparisons are slower than others and discuss how to optimize your code for better performance. 

## Floating-point arithmetic

The first thing to understand is that floating-point arithmetic is more complex than integer arithmetic. Floating-point numbers are represented using the IEEE 754 standard, which uses a sign bit, exponent, and mantissa to represent the number. 

Because of this complexity, floating-point arithmetic is inherently slower than integer arithmetic. In addition, float < integer comparisons require an implicit cast of the integer to a float, which also adds overhead. 

## Caching and branch prediction

Another factor that can impact the speed of float < integer comparisons is caching and branch prediction. 

Modern CPUs have multiple levels of cache, which store data that is frequently accessed by the CPU. When a program accesses data in cache, it can significantly reduce the time it takes to perform that operation. 

Similarly, branch prediction is a technique that CPUs use to predict the outcome of conditional statements, such as if/else statements. When the CPU correctly predicts the outcome of a conditional statement, it can prevent the pipeline from stalling and improve performance. However, when the prediction is incorrect, it can cause a pipeline flush, which can be very expensive. 

In the case of float < integer comparisons, some values may be frequently accessed and stored in cache, while others may not be. Similarly, some values may be more predictable than others, leading to better branch prediction. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, not all float < integer comparisons are equally fast in Python. Floating-point arithmetic, caching, and branch prediction can all impact the speed of these operations. 

To optimize your code for better performance, you can try to minimize the number of float < integer comparisons, store frequently accessed values in cache, and use values that are more predictable. Additionally, you can consider using a different data type, such as integers or fixed-point numbers, if precision is not critical.
