## Introduction
Thread identification is an essential step in multithreaded programming, as it enables developers to keep track of how threads are executing and handle them efficiently. In Python, obtaining a thread id is a straightforward process, and it can be achieved in a few different ways. This article will discuss two methods for obtaining thread ids in Python.

## Method 1: using the `threading` module

The `threading` module in Python provides a `current_thread()` function that returns an instance of the current thread. The `ident` attribute of the thread object can be used to obtain the thread id, as shown below:

```
import threading
    
current_thread = threading.current_thread()
print(f"Thread id: {current_thread.ident}")
```

The `current_thread()` function returns the current thread object, and the `ident` attribute of the same object is used to extract the thread id.

## Method 2: using the `get_ident()` function

Python also provides `get_ident()` function in the `thread` module that can be used to obtain the thread id. This method is shorter and more convenient than the `threading` method discussed earlier. Here's an example:

```
import _thread
    
thread_id = _thread.get_ident()
print(f"Thread id: {thread_id}")
```

The `_thread.get_ident()` function can be used to get the thread id of the executing thread.

## Conclusion
In Python, obtaining the thread id is an easy task that can be achieved using either the `threading` module or the `thread` module. The `threading` method is more verbose than the `thread` method, but it provides more functionality for managing threads. Whichever method you choose, make sure to use it appropriately to avoid issues in your multithreaded applications.
