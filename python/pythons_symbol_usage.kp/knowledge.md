# Definition

The "@" symbol is used in Python to denote a decorator. A decorator is a special type of function that takes another function as an argument and adds some kind of functionality to it.

# Usage

Decorators are used in Python to modify or extend a function's behavior without having to rewrite the entire code. This is done by wrapping the function in the decorator, which is written with the "@" symbol.

# Example

For example, if you wanted to add logging to a function, you could use a decorator to do so. The code for the decorator might look something like this:

```
@logging_decorator
def some_function():
    # code here
```

# Benefits

The main benefit of using decorators is that they allow you to easily add extra functionality to a function without having to rewrite the entire code. This makes code more maintainable and easier to debug.
