# Section 1: Define Generator
A generator in Python is a function that returns an iterator object. This object can be used to iterate over a sequence of values, such as a list, tuple, or dictionary. 

# Section 2: Pick One Item
To pick one item from a generator, the generator must first be called. This can be done using the next() method, which will return the next item in the sequence. If the generator has already been exhausted, then a StopIteration exception will be raised. 

# Section 3: Store Item
The item that is returned from the generator can then be stored in a variable. This allows the item to be used later in the program. 

# Section 4: Iterate Through Generator
Once the item has been stored, the generator can be iterated through using the next() method. This will allow the program to access each item in the sequence until the generator has been exhausted.
