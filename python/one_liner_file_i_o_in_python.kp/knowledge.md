tldr: To open, read, and close a file in one line of code in Python, use the `with open` statement.

## Using with statement

Using the `with` statement is the best way to open, read, and close a file in one line of code in Python. It automatically closes the file when the block inside the `with` statement is exited. Here's an example:

```python
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f: print(f.read())
```

In this example, `open('file.txt', 'r')` creates a file object in read mode and `f.read()` reads the entire contents of the file. The `with` statement ensures that the file is closed when the `print()` function finishes executing.

## Explanation

Let's break down the above one-liner:

- The `open()` function opens the file `file.txt` in read mode ('r') and returns a file object named `f`.
- The `with` statement ensures that the file is closed when the `with` block ends.
- The code inside the with block `print(f.read())` reads the entire contents of the file and prints them to stdout.

This pattern is a common way to work with files in Python, and is considered best practice.

## Benefits of using the with statement

Using the `with` statement to open, read, and close files has several benefits:

1. It ensures that the file is always closed, even if an error occurs.
2. It is more concise and easier to read than opening and closing files manually.
3. It is considered best practice when working with files in Python.

## Conclusion

In Python, the `with` statement is the easiest and most commonly used way to open, read, and close files in one line of code. It ensures that files are closed properly even if an error occurs, and is considered best practice.
