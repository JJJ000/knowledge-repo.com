## Introduction
Pytest is a powerful testing framework for Python that allows developers to test their code efficiently. While pytest is generally used to run multiple tests within a test suite, it's also possible to test a single file at a time. This is useful when you want to test a specific module or component of your application. In this article, we'll discuss how to test single file under pytest in Python.

## Creating a Test File
First, we need to create a test file for the module or component that we want to test. The file should contain test cases that cover the functionality of the module or component. The test file should follow a specific naming convention to be recognized by pytest.

Naming Convention: test_<module_name>.py

For example, if we want to test a module called "calculator," we should create a file called "test_calculator.py". This naming convention tells pytest that this is a test file, and it should be included in the test suite.

## Running Tests with Pytest
To run tests for the specific file, we need to navigate to the directory that contains the test file and run the pytest command.

$ pytest test_calculator.py

This command will run all the test cases defined in the "test_calculator.py" file. If the file has multiple test cases, pytest will run them all and produce a report with the results.

## Conclusion
In this article, we discussed how to test a single file under pytest in Python. We learned that we need to create a test file with a specific naming convention and run the pytest command with the file name to execute the tests. This approach helps us to test specific modules or components of our application efficiently, ensuring that they work correctly without any issues.
