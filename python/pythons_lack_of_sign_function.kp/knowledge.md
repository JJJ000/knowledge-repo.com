tldr: Python does not have a sign function because it does not need one, as the same result can be achieved using the built-in abs() function.

#### No Need for a Sign Function
Python does not have a sign function because it is not necessary. Python has a built-in function called abs() which can be used to determine the absolute value of a number. This means that the sign of the number is irrelevant and can be determined simply by looking at the absolute value.

#### Other Ways to Determine Sign
In addition to the abs() function, there are other ways to determine the sign of a number in Python. The comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=) can be used to compare a number to zero and determine its sign. For example, if a number is greater than zero, it is positive.

#### Easier to Understand
Using the comparison operators to determine the sign of a number is often easier to understand than a sign function. A sign function may require additional parameters or more complicated logic. By using comparison operators, the code is more concise and easier to read.

#### More Flexible
Using comparison operators also allows for more flexibility when determining the sign of a number. For example, if a number is greater than or equal to zero, it can be considered positive. This is not possible with a sign function.
