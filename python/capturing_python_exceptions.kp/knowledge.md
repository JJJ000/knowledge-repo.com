# Overview

Exception handling is an important part of software development. It is used to capture and report errors that occur during the execution of a program. Python provides a built-in mechanism for capturing and reporting exceptions, called the "Exception Message Capture" (EMC).

# What is Exception Message Capture?

Exception Message Capture (EMC) is a mechanism for capturing and reporting errors that occur during the execution of a program. It is used to detect and report errors that might otherwise be missed. The mechanism consists of a set of functions that are called when an exception is raised. These functions can be used to log the exception and its associated information, such as the line number where the exception occurred and the stack trace.

# How Does it Work?

When an exception is raised, the Python interpreter calls the EMC functions. The EMC functions are responsible for capturing the exception and its associated information. This information is then logged in a log file or sent to an external service such as an error reporting system.

# Benefits of Exception Message Capture

Exception Message Capture provides a way to detect and report errors that might otherwise be missed. It can help to identify and fix bugs quickly, as well as provide useful information for debugging. Additionally, it can help to improve the overall quality of a program by making it more robust.
