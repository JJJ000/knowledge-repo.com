## Section 1: Problem Statement

In Python, we often work with dictionaries where we need to remove multiple keys from the dictionary. While removing multiple keys from the dictionary, we may face multiple problems such as mutating the dictionary while iterating over it, or trying to remove non-existing keys. In this task, we need to explore how we can remove multiple keys from a dictionary safely.


## Section 2: Removing Multiple Keys from a Dictionary

We can remove multiple keys from a dictionary using any of the two methods: 

### Method 1: Using a loop to iterate over the keys

We can use a loop to iterate over the keys and remove the key from the dictionary if it exists. However, we need to be careful not to mutate the dictionary while iterating over it. To avoid this, we can create a new dictionary with the required keys.

```python
# Example using loop to remove multiple keys safely
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}
keys_to_remove = ['a', 'c']

new_dict = {}
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    if key not in keys_to_remove:
        new_dict[key] = value
my_dict = new_dict
print(my_dict) # Output: {'b': 2, 'd': 4}
```

### Method 2: Using dictionary comprehension

We can use a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary from the given dictionary with only the required keys.

```python
# Example using dictionary comprehension to remove multiple keys safely
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}
keys_to_remove = ['a', 'c']

new_dict = {key: value for key, value in my_dict.items() if key not in keys_to_remove}
my_dict = new_dict
print(my_dict) # Output: {'b': 2, 'd': 4}
```


## Section 3: Handling non-existing keys

In some cases, we may try to remove a key that does not exist in the dictionary. To handle such cases safely, we can use the `pop()` method with a default value. If the key is not found in the dictionary, the default value is returned without raising an exception.

```python
# Example handling non-existing keys safely
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}
keys_to_remove = ['a', 'e']

for key in keys_to_remove:
    my_dict.pop(key, None)
print(my_dict) # Output: {'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}
```


## Section 4: Conclusion

In this task, we explored two methods to remove multiple keys from a dictionary safely. We also saw how we can handle non-existing keys while removing them from a dictionary. By following these methods, we can easily remove multiple keys from a dictionary without mutating it or raising exceptions.
