[TOC]

Yes, explicitly closing files is important in Python. 

Section 1: Resource management 
Open files consume system resources such as file descriptors. It is important to close files as it frees up these resources so that they can be utilized elsewhere in the program.

Section 2: Data integrity 
Not closing files may result in data loss or corruption. Any buffered data in the file may not be written to the file until the file is closed. If the program terminates abruptly, any unsaved data may be lost.

Section 3: Avoiding errors 
Leaving files open can result in errors, especially if the file is opened in write or append mode. If the program attempts to access the file again while it is still open, it may result in an error.

Section 4: Good programming practice 
Explicitly closing files is a good programming practice that ensures the program is well-organized and easy to understand. It also ensures that the program behaves predictably and reduces the chances of unwanted side effects.
