## Introduction
IPython is an interactive command-line interface for Python. It provides a more interactive and powerful Python shell compared to the default Python shell. One of the main advantages of using IPython is its ability to execute code snippets and evaluate their results in real-time. In this article, we will see how to run a Python script inside IPython.

## Starting IPython
Before we start running a Python script inside IPython, we need to install IPython on our system. We can do this using pip:

```python
pip install ipython
```

Once IPython is installed, we can start it by simply typing "ipython" in the command prompt or terminal.

## Running a Python script inside IPython
To run a Python script inside IPython, we first need to open the script in a text editor and save it with a .py extension. Once we have done this, we can simply use the %run magic command to run the script. For example, if we have a script called "myscript.py", we can run it inside IPython by typing:

```python
%run myscript.py
```

IPython will execute the script and display its output in the terminal. If the script requires any command line arguments, we can pass them after the script name:

```python
%run myscript.py arg1 arg2
```

We can also use the %load magic command to load the contents of a Python script into an IPython cell. This can be useful if we want to modify the script before running it. For example, if we have a script called "myscript.py", we can load it into an IPython cell by typing:

```python
%load myscript.py
```

IPython will load the contents of the script into the cell. We can then modify the script and run it by typing %run myscript.py as before.

## Conclusion
In this article, we have seen how to run a Python script inside IPython. IPython provides a more interactive and powerful Python shell compared to the default Python shell, which makes it a great choice for developing and testing Python code. By using the %run and %load magic commands, we can seamlessly integrate Python scripts into our IPython workflow.
