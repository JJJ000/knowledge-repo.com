Section 1: Introduction to Beautiful Soup

Beautiful Soup is a Python library that is commonly used for web scraping. It is designed to make parsing HTML and XML documents easy and can be used to extract data from web pages. Beautiful Soup provides several ways to navigate and search through the HTML tree structure including searching for tags, attributes, and text. It can also modify the contents of an HTML page.

Section 2: Extracting Attribute Values with Beautiful Soup

Beautiful Soup allows you to search for and extract specific attributes in an HTML document. The `find_all` method can be used to search for a tag with a particular attribute.

The following example shows how to extract the value of the `href` attribute from all `a` tags in an HTML document:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

html_doc = """
<html>
<body>
<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
<a href="https://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>
</body>
</html>
"""

soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, 'html.parser')
links = soup.find_all('a')

for link in links:
    print(link.get('href'))
```

The `find_all` method searches for all `a` tags and then the `get` method is used to extract the value of the `href` attribute for each link.

Section 3: Extracting Multiple Attribute Values

In some cases, you may need to extract multiple attributes from a tag. To do this, you can use the `attrs` attribute of the tag object. The `attrs` attribute returns a dictionary of all attributes and their values for the tag.

The following example shows how to extract both the `href` and `class` attributes from all `a` tags in an HTML document:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

html_doc = """
<html>
<body>
<a href="https://www.google.com" class="link">Google</a>
<a href="https://www.yahoo.com" class="link">Yahoo</a>
</body>
</html>
"""

soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, 'html.parser')
links = soup.find_all('a')

for link in links:
    print(link.attrs['href'], link.attrs['class'])
```

The `attrs` attribute is used to extract both the `href` and `class` attributes from each link.

Section 4: Conclusion

Beautiful Soup makes it easy to extract attribute values from HTML documents in Python. Using the `find_all` method and the `get` method, you can extract the value of a single attribute. If you need to extract multiple attributes, you can use the `attrs` attribute of the tag object to extract a dictionary of all attributes and their values.
