## What is a Tree Builder?
A tree builder is an object in a programming language or library that allows for the construction of a hierarchical tree structure from a series of tokens. It is used in parsing, or the process of breaking down a text or other data into its component parts.

## What is lxml?
lxml is a Python library for processing XML and HTML. It is a powerful and easy-to-use library that provides support for parsing and manipulating XML and HTML documents. It is based on the popular libxml2 and libxslt C libraries.

## Why is lxml Necessary?
In order to use the features of lxml, it must first be installed on the system. Without lxml installed, the tree builder will not be able to construct the hierarchical tree structure from the tokens.

## How to Install lxml?
Installing lxml is simple and straightforward. The easiest way is to use pip, the Python package manager. Simply open a terminal window and type in the following command: 

```pip install lxml``` 

This will install lxml on your system.
