# Section 1: Argparse Overview
Argparse is a Python module that enables users to easily create command line interfaces. It allows users to specify optional and positional arguments, as well as other options for the program.

# Section 2: Optional Arguments
Optional arguments are arguments that are not required for the program to run, but can be provided by the user to modify the program's behavior. These arguments are specified by the user in the command line, and their values are stored in the "args" object.

# Section 3: Required Arguments
Required arguments are arguments that must be provided by the user in order for the program to run. These arguments are also specified in the command line, but they must be specified in order for the program to run.

# Section 4: Argparse Formatting
In Argparse, required arguments are listed under the "optional arguments" section. This is because they are optional in the sense that the user does not have to provide them in order for the program to run, but they are required in order for the program to run correctly.
