#1 Using Python's `platform` Module

The `platform` module in Python provides access to the underlying platform's data, such as the operating system name and version. To find the current operating system, you can use the `platform.system()` method. This method returns a string that contains the name of the operating system.

#2 Using Python's `os` Module

The `os` module in Python provides access to the operating system's environment variables, and can be used to determine the current operating system. You can use the `os.name` attribute to get the name of the operating system. This attribute returns a string that contains the name of the operating system.

#3 Using Python's `sys` Module

The `sys` module in Python provides access to system-specific parameters and functions, and can be used to determine the current operating system. You can use the `sys.platform` attribute to get the name of the operating system. This attribute returns a string that contains the name of the operating system.

#4 Using Python's `ctypes` Module

The `ctypes` module in Python provides access to the C types library, and can be used to determine the current operating system. You can use the `ctypes.util.find_library()` method to get the name of the operating system. This method returns a string that contains the name of the operating system.
