tldr: You can use the groupby.transform() method with the max() function to get the row(s) with the max value in each group.

**Section 1: GroupBy Object**

The first step is to create a GroupBy object. This is done by using the `groupby()` method on a dataframe. This method requires a column or list of columns to group by. The resulting object will be a GroupBy object.

**Section 2: Aggregate Function**

The next step is to apply an aggregate function to the GroupBy object. This can be done using the `agg()` method. This method requires a function as an argument, which will be applied to each group. For example, to get the maximum value in each group, use the `max()` function.

**Section 3: Get Max Value**

Once the aggregate function has been applied, the resulting dataframe will contain the maximum value for each group. To get the row(s) which have the max value in each group, use the `idxmax()` method. This method will return the index of the row with the max value.

**Section 4: Retrieve Rows**

Finally, use the `loc()` method to retrieve the rows with the max value. This method requires the index of the row as an argument. The resulting dataframe will contain the row(s) with the max value.
