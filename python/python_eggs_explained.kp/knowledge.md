# Definition

A Python egg is an archive file format used to package Python software for distribution. It is a zipped file with a .egg extension.

# History

Python eggs were introduced in 2004 with the release of Python 2.3. The format was intended to be a replacement for the older .tar.gz format, which was difficult to use for Python software.

# Uses

Python eggs are used to package and distribute Python software, including libraries, scripts, and other components. They are used to simplify the installation process for users, as they can be installed with a single command.

# Alternatives

Python eggs are not the only format used for packaging Python software. Other formats, such as wheels, have become popular in recent years. Wheels are similar to eggs, but have some additional features, such as support for multiple Python versions.
