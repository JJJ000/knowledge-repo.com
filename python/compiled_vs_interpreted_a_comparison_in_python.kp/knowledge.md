tldr: Python is an interpreted language, meaning that it is executed line-by-line at runtime, while compiled languages are pre-compiled into machine-readable code before execution.

# Compiled Languages
A compiled language is a programming language that is converted into machine code that can be read by the computer at runtime. This conversion process is known as compilation. Compiled languages are typically faster than interpreted languages because the code is already converted into machine code and does not need to be interpreted at runtime.

# Interpreted Languages
An interpreted language is a programming language that is not compiled into machine code, but instead is interpreted at runtime. This means that the code is read and executed line by line, as it is encountered. Interpreted languages are typically slower than compiled languages because the code must be read and interpreted each time it is executed.

# Python
Python is a hybrid language that combines both compiled and interpreted language features. Python code is first compiled into an intermediate bytecode, which is then interpreted by the Python interpreter. This allows Python to be both fast and easy to use, as the code is compiled into a more efficient form before being interpreted.
