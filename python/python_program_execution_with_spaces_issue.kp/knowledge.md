tldr: Use subprocess.Popen with the argument as a list of strings, where each string is a separate command-line argument.

Section 1: Introduction
Sometimes, you may need to execute a program from Python to perform some tasks. One way to do this is by using the `os.system()` method. However, sometimes it may fail due to spaces in the path. In this tutorial, we will explore different ways to execute a program from Python, even if it has spaces in the path.

Section 2: Using subprocess module
One way to execute a program from Python is by using the `subprocess` module. This module provides a way to spawn new processes, connect to their input/output/error pipes, and obtain their return codes. To execute a program using subprocess, you can use `subprocess.run()` method as follows:

```
import subprocess
subprocess.run(["<path_to_program>", "<arg1>", "<arg2>", "<arg3>"])
```

Here, `<path_to_program>` is the path of the program you want to execute, and `<arg1>`, `<arg2>`, `<arg3>` are the arguments to be passed to the program. You can also use different parameters of `subprocess.run()` method to control the behavior of the process.

One advantage of using subprocess is that it handles spaces in the path automatically, so you don't need to worry about it.

Section 3: Using os.startfile method
Another way to execute a program from Python is by using `os.startfile` method. This method opens a file with its associated program. To use this method, you can simply specify the path of the program as follows:

```
import os
os.startfile("<path_to_program>")
```

This method also handles spaces in the path automatically.

Section 4: Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have explored different ways to execute a program from Python, even if it has spaces in the path. You can use `subprocess` module or `os.startfile` method to execute a program without worrying about the spaces in the path. Choose the method that suits your needs best.
