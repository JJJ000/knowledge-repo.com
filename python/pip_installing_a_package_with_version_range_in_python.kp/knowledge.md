tldr: You can specify a version range when installing a package using pip by using the `==` operator followed by the min and max versions separated by a comma, e.g. `pip install <package>==<min\_version>,<max\_version>`.

# Step 1: Install the Package
The first step to pip install a package with a min and max version range is to install the package. This is done using the pip install command.

# Step 2: Specify Version Range
The second step is to specify the version range. This is done by adding two flags to the pip install command: --min-version and --max-version. These flags allow us to specify the minimum version and maximum version of the package that we want to install. 

# Step 3: Execute the Command
The third step is to execute the command. This is done by running the pip install command with the --min-version and --max-version flags.

# Step 4: Verify Installation
The fourth and final step is to verify that the package has been installed correctly. This can be done by running the pip list command to view the installed packages and their versions.
