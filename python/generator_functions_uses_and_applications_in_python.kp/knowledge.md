tldr: Generator functions can be used to create iterators that generate a sequence of values on-the-fly, without loading the entire sequence into memory at once.

## Iteration and Stream Processing

Generator functions are used to create iterator objects. These iterator objects can be used to perform iteration and stream processing of data. For example, you can use generator functions to implement lazy evaluation of large data sets, which allows you to process data one piece at a time as needed, rather than load the entire dataset into memory.

## Memory Optimization

Generator functions can also be used to optimize memory usage in your Python programs. Rather than creating large, memory-intensive data structures, you can use generator functions to generate the data on-the-fly as needed, in smaller chunks or one item at a time, allowing you to avoid running out of memory.

## Infinite Sequences and Event Streams

Generator functions can be used to generate infinite sequences of values, which is helpful in many contexts, such as when working with event streams. For example, you can use a generator function to generate an infinite sequence of random numbers, or an event stream that continuously listens for new data and yields it when it becomes available.

## Coroutine Implementation

Generator functions can also be used to implement coroutines in Python. A coroutine is a specialized type of function that allows for non-blocking I/O and event-driven programming, which can be very useful in network programming and other applications where performance is critical. By using generator functions, you can create a coroutine that can be paused and resumed, allowing it to handle multiple tasks simultaneously without blocking.
