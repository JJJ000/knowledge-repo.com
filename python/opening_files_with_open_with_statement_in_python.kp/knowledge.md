## Introduction
Python provides different ways to open and read files. One of the methods is using the `open()` function which provides a simple way to access files in the file system. However, the `open()` function has some limitations that can make it difficult to open certain files or perform certain operations. To overcome these limitations, Python provides the `open with` statement. The `with` statement is a context manager that ensures that the file is opened and closed properly, even in case of exceptions.

## Syntax
The `with` statement has the following syntax:

```python
with open(file_path, mode) as file_variable:
    # perform file operations
``` 

## Parameters
The `with` statement takes two parameters:

1. `file_path`: the path to the file that needs to be opened
2. `mode`: the mode in which the file needs to be opened - read mode (`'r'`), write mode (`'w'`), append mode (`'a'`), binary mode (`'b'`)

## Steps to open a file using the with statement
To open a file using the `with` statement, you can follow the steps below:

1. Define the file path and mode
2. Use the `with` statement to open the file and assign it to a file variable
3. Perform file operations within the `with` block

```python
# Step 1: Define the file path and mode
file_path = 'file.txt'
mode = 'r'

# Step 2: Use the with statement to open the file and assign it to a file variable
with open(file_path, mode) as file_variable:
    # Step 3: Perform file operations within the with block
    contents = file_variable.read()
    print(contents)
```

In the above example, we are opening a file named `file.txt` in read mode using the `with` statement. We are assigning the file to a variable named `file_variable`. We are then reading the contents of the file using the `read()` method and printing the contents to the console.

## Conclusion
The `with` statement is a convenient way to open and read files in Python. It ensures that the file is opened and closed properly, even in the case of exceptions. By using the `with` statement, you can simplify your file operations and avoid many common errors that can occur when working with files.
