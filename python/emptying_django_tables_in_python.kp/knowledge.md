tldr: To remove all of the data in a table using Django in Python, use the `Model.objects.all().delete()` method.

## Import necessary modules
The first step is to import the necessary modules required for accessing the models and database in Django. 

```python
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand, CommandError
from myapp.models import MyModel
```

In the above code snippet, we import `BaseCommand`, which is a useful class that can be used to create custom Django management commands. We also import `CommandError`, which is used to raise exceptions if there is an error in the command.

Next, we import the `MyModel` model from the `myapp` app. This is the model whose table we want to clear.

## Define the command
After importing the necessary modules, the next step is to define the command. We do this by creating a new class that inherits from `BaseCommand`.

```python
class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = 'Clears all data in the MyModel table'

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        MyModel.objects.all().delete()
        self.stdout.write(self.style.SUCCESS('Successfully cleared data in MyModel table'))
```

In the above code snippet, we define a new class called `Command` that inherits from `BaseCommand`. We set the `help` attribute to a string that describes what the command does.

We then define a `handle` method that is called when the command is executed. In this method, we use the `all()` method of the `MyModel` model manager to retrieve all objects in the database and then call the `delete()` method to delete them.

Finally, we use the `stdout.write()` method to print a success message to the console.

## Register the command
The final step is to register the command with Django. We do this by creating a `management` directory in our app and adding an `__init__.py` file to it. We then create a new Python module in the directory, with any name we want, and add the following code to it:

```python
from django.core.management import execute_from_command_line
from myapp.management.commands import clear_mymodel

execute_from_command_line()
```

In the above code snippet, we import the `execute_from_command_line` method from the `django.core.management` module. This method is responsible for executing commands from the command line.

We then import the `clear_mymodel` command we defined earlier and register it with Django by adding it to the `management.commands` module.

Finally, we call `execute_from_command_line()` to execute the command. 

## Usage
To use the command, we run the following command in the terminal:

```
python manage.py clear_mymodel
```

This should delete all data in the `MyModel` table.

Note: It's important to remember that this command will permanently delete all data in the table. Make sure you have a backup before running it.
