tldr: Ruby has a more concise syntax and easier-to-read code, whereas Python has a larger standard library and better support for scientific computing.

## Ruby has...

### 1. Blocks and Lambdas

Ruby has built-in support for blocks and lambdas. Blocks essentially allow you to pass anonymous functions to a method. Lambdas are similar, but they are objects that can be assigned to a variable and called later, making them closer to Python’s `lambda` expressions. 

### 2. Method Chaining

Ruby’s method chaining allows you to write code that reads like a sentence. It allows you to chain method calls together to create more complex expressions. This can make code easier to read and understand, but it can also make debugging more difficult.

### 3. ActiveSupport

ActiveSupport is a set of utility classes and extensions that are commonly used in Ruby on Rails development. It provides things like date and time formatting, string manipulation, and other helpful utilities that can make coding in Ruby more efficient.

## Python has...

### 1. List Comprehensions

List comprehensions allow you to construct a list using a single line of code. They can be used to iterate over a sequence and apply a function to each element, making them a powerful tool for data processing.

### 2. Exception Handling

Python has robust exception handling capabilities. Exceptions are raised when errors occur, and Python provides a clear way to handle them using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks. This makes Python code more fault-tolerant and easier to debug.

### 3. PEPs

Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) are proposals for improvements to the Python language. They provide a structured way for developers to suggest changes or additions to the language, ensuring that Python continues to evolve and stay relevant.
