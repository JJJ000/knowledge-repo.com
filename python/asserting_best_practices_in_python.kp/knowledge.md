# 1. Use Appropriate Assertions
When using assert in Python, it is important to use assertions that are appropriate to the code being tested. For example, if a code is expected to return a certain value, an assertion should be used to check that the returned value is correct. Similarly, if a function is expected to produce a certain output, an assertion should be used to check that the output is as expected.

# 2. Assertions Should Be Informative
When using assertions, it is important to make sure that the assertions are informative. This means that the assertion should provide enough information to allow the programmer to understand why the assertion failed and what needs to be done to fix the issue.

# 3. Assertions Should Be Readable
When using assertions, it is important to make sure that the assertions are readable. This means that the assertion should be written in such a way that it is easy to understand and to debug.

# 4. Assertions Should Be Tested
When using assertions, it is important to make sure that the assertions are tested. This means that the assertions should be tested in a variety of different scenarios to ensure that they are working correctly.
