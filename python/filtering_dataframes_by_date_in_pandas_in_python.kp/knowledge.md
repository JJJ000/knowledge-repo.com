**Section 1: Overview**

Filtering Pandas DataFrames on dates can be a useful way to quickly analyze data. It allows users to quickly select data from a certain time period, or to identify outliers. Pandas has a number of built-in functions and methods to help with this task, including the .loc and .between methods.

**Section 2: .loc Method**

The .loc method is a powerful tool for selecting data based on dates. It takes a single argument, the date or range of dates for which you want to filter. For example, to select all rows from a DataFrame between two dates, you could use the following syntax:

```
df.loc[(df['date'] >= start_date) & (df['date'] <= end_date)]
```

The .loc method is especially useful if you need to select data from a specific date or time range.

**Section 3: .between Method**

The .between method is similar to the .loc method, but it allows you to specify a date range in a single argument. This can be useful if you want to quickly select all rows within a certain date range. For example, to select all rows between two dates, you could use the following syntax:

```
df.between(start_date, end_date)
```

**Section 4: Conclusion**

Filtering Pandas DataFrames on dates is a useful tool for quickly analyzing data. The .loc and .between methods are two powerful tools for selecting data based on dates. With these methods, you can quickly select data from a certain time period or identify outliers.
