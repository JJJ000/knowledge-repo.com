### Yes

Import statements should always be at the top of a module in Python to ensure that the code is properly organized and easy to read. Import statements should be placed before any other code in the module, including global variables, class definitions, and function definitions. This allows the interpreter to properly recognize and process the imported libraries before any other code is executed.

### Benefits

Having import statements at the top of a module in Python provides several benefits. First, it makes the code easier to read and understand. By placing the import statements at the top, it is easier to see which libraries are being used in the code. This can help with debugging and understanding the code.

Second, it allows the interpreter to properly recognize and process the imported libraries before any other code is executed. This ensures that the code runs properly and that any errors are caught and handled before they can cause problems.

Finally, it makes the code more organized and easier to maintain. By placing the import statements at the top, the code is more organized and easier to update or modify. This can help save time and ensure that the code is up-to-date and functioning properly.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, import statements should always be at the top of a module in Python. This ensures that the code is properly organized and easy to read, and it allows the interpreter to properly recognize and process the imported libraries before any other code is executed. Additionally, it makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.
