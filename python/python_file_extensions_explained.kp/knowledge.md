[TOC]

# .pyc

The .pyc extension stands for "Python Compiled". It is a compiled version of a Python script, which is created the first time a Python script is run. This file is a binary file, which is not easily readable by humans, but can be executed much faster than the original .py file.

# .pyd

The .pyd extension stands for "Python Dynamic Module". It is a shared library of Python code, which can be imported into other Python programs. This allows for code reuse and faster execution of code.

# .pyo

The .pyo extension stands for "Python Optimized". It is a version of a Python script which has been optimized for faster execution. This is done by removing some of the debugging information from the script.
