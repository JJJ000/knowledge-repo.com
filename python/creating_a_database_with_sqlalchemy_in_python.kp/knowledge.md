tldr: To create a new database using SQLAlchemy in Python, one can first create a database engine and then use the create\_all() method to create tables in that database.

[TOC]

## Section 1: Installing and importing the necessary packages

To create a new database using SQLAlchemy in Python, you will need to have the following packages installed:
* SQLAlchemy
* psycopg2 (for PostgreSQL database) or mysql-connector-python (for MySQL database) or sqlite3 (for SQLite database)

You can install these packages using pip or any other package manager.

Once you have installed the necessary packages, you can import them in your Python script as follows:

```python
import sqlalchemy
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
```

## Section 2: Creating a database engine

The next step is to create a database engine using the `create_engine()` method provided by SQLAlchemy. This engine will be responsible for connecting to the database and executing queries.

```python
engine = create_engine('database://username:password@host:port/database_name')
```

Here, `database` is the type of database you are using (e.g. postgres, mysql, sqlite), `username` and `password` are the credentials to access the database, `host` is the database server address and `port` is the port on which the database server is listening. `database_name` is the name of the database you want to create.

## Section 3: Creating a new database

To create a new database using SQLAlchemy, you first need to define a metadata object that will hold a collection of table definitions.

```python
from sqlalchemy import MetaData

metadata = MetaData()
```

Once you have defined the metadata object, you can use the `create_all()` method provided by SQLAlchemy to create the database.

```python
metadata.create_all(engine)
```

This will create all the tables defined in your metadata object in the database.

## Section 4: Conclusion

That's it! You have successfully created a new database using SQLAlchemy in Python. You can now use the database to store data and execute queries using SQLAlchemy.
