# Section 1: Import the Necessary Modules

In order to write JSON data to a file in Python, we must first import the necessary modules. 

```
import json
import os
```

# Section 2: Create the JSON Data

Next, we must create the JSON data that we would like to write to the file. This can be done by creating a dictionary or list of data and then using the `json.dumps()` function to convert it to a JSON string. 

```
data = {
    'name': 'Bob',
    'age': 25,
    'job': 'Developer'
}

json_data = json.dumps(data)
```

# Section 3: Write the JSON Data to a File

Once we have the JSON data, we can use the `open()` function to open a file and then the `write()` function to write the JSON data to the file. 

```
with open('data.json', 'w') as f:
    f.write(json_data)
```

# Section 4: Close the File

Finally, we must close the file when we are done writing to it. This can be done using the `close()` function. 

```
f.close()
```
