tldr: You can use the `sorted` function with a `key` argument that is a tuple of attributes to sort by.

**Section 1: Gather Data**

The first step in sorting a list by multiple attributes is to gather the data you want to sort. This means collecting the data as a list of objects. For example, if you wanted to sort a list of students by their name, age, and grade, you would need to create a list of objects that contain the name, age, and grade of each student.

**Section 2: Define Sort Criteria**

The next step is to define the sort criteria. This means deciding which attribute you want to sort by first, second, and so on. For example, if you wanted to sort the student list by name, age, and grade, you would need to decide which attribute to sort by first, second, and third.

**Section 3: Sort List**

Once the sort criteria has been defined, the list can be sorted. This can be done using Python’s built-in sorting functions, such as the sorted() function. The sorted() function takes a list and a sorting criteria as arguments and returns a new list sorted according to the criteria.

**Section 4: Output Sorted List**

Finally, the sorted list can be outputted. This can be done using Python’s print() function. The print() function takes a list as an argument and prints it to the console.
