## Problem

The issue at hand is that the `nohup` command in Python is not writing logs to the specified output file.

## Possible Causes

There could be a few reasons why this is happening:

1. Syntax error in the command
2. Permission issues on the output file or directory
3. The output file is not being specified correctly
4. An issue with the logging package or code

## Solution

1. Double-check the syntax of the `nohup` command to make sure everything is correct. Make sure the command is pointing to the correct file and that the appropriate parameters are being passed.
2. Verify that the user running the command has the correct permissions on the output file or directory.
3. Ensure that the output file is being specified correctly. Check the path and file name to make sure there are no typos or errors.
4. If everything else looks good, it's possible that there is an issue with the logging package or code. Check the code to make sure there are no errors, and consider using a different logging method to debug the issue. For example, you could try using the `print` function to write output to the console instead of a file to ensure that the code is executing properly. You could also try using an existing logging method such as the `logging` package to see if that resolves the issue.
