# Section 1: Introduction
BeautifulSoup is a Python library used for extracting data from HTML and XML files. It is commonly used for web scraping, which is the process of extracting data from websites. One of the most useful features of BeautifulSoup is its ability to extract the href attribute from HTML elements. In this article, we will discuss how to use BeautifulSoup to get the href attribute from HTML elements.

# Section 2: Finding href Attributes
The first step in using BeautifulSoup to get the href attribute from HTML elements is to create a BeautifulSoup object from a given HTML document. This can be done using the `BeautifulSoup()` function, which takes in a string of HTML code as an argument. Once the BeautifulSoup object is created, we can use the `find_all()` method to search the HTML document for elements with the href attribute.

# Section 3: Extracting href Attributes
Once the elements with the href attribute have been found, we can use the `get()` method to extract the href attribute from each element. The `get()` method takes in a string argument which specifies the attribute to be extracted. In this case, we are looking for the href attribute, so we would pass in “href” as the argument.

# Section 4: Conclusion
In this article, we discussed how to use BeautifulSoup to get the href attribute from HTML elements. We discussed how to create a BeautifulSoup object from a given HTML document, how to search for elements with the href attribute, and how to extract the href attribute from each element. With this knowledge, you should be able to use BeautifulSoup to easily extract the href attribute from HTML elements.
