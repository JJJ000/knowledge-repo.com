tldr: Yes, `pass` does nothing and `continue` skips the rest of the loop and continues with the next iteration.

# Definition

"pass" is a statement in Python that indicates that nothing needs to be done. It is a placeholder and is often used when a statement is required syntactically, but no code needs to be executed.

"continue" is also a statement in Python that is used to skip the current iteration of a loop, and move on to the next iteration. 

# Usage

"pass" is typically used when an empty loop is needed or when a statement is required for the program to run but no action is needed.

"continue" is used when the program needs to skip the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next one.

# Difference

The main difference between "pass" and "continue" is that "pass" does nothing, while "continue" skips the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next one.
