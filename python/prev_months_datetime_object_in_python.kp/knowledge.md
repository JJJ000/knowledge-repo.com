tldr: You can use the `datetime` module and its `replace` method to get the datetime object of the previous month `previous\_month = datetime.now().replace(month=datetime.now().month-1)`

Section 1: Introduction to the problem and datetime object
In Python, a datetime object is a way to represent a date and time. It has various attributes such as year, month, day, hour, minute, second, and microsecond. In this problem, we need to find the datetime object of the previous month.

Section 2: Using the datetime module
Python provides the datetime module that can be used to work with dates and times. We can use this module to create a datetime object for the current date and time. Once we have the current datetime object, we can use the replace() method to get the datetime object of the previous month.

Here's the code to do it:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Get the current datetime object
now = datetime.now()

# Get the first day of the current month
first_day = now.replace(day=1)

# Subtract one day from the first day of the current month
last_month = first_day - timedelta(days=1)

# Get the year and month of the previous month
year = last_month.year
month = last_month.month

# Create a datetime object for the first day of the previous month
first_day_last_month = datetime(year, month, 1)

# Print the datetime object of the previous month
print(first_day_last_month)
```

This will give you the datetime object for the first day of the previous month.

Section 3: Alternative method using calendar module
Another way to get the datetime object of the previous month is to use the calendar module. The calendar module provides a set of methods to work with calendars, such as calculating the number of days in a month, the first weekday of a month, etc.

Here's the code to get the datetime object of the previous month using the calendar module:

```python
import calendar

# Get the current date and time
now = datetime.now()

# Get the year and month of the previous month
year, month = now.year, now.month - 1
if month == 0:
    year -= 1
    month = 12

# Get the number of days in the previous month
num_days = calendar.monthrange(year, month)[1]

# Create a datetime object for the last day of the previous month
last_day_last_month = datetime(year, month, num_days)

# Print the datetime object of the previous month
print(last_day_last_month)
```

This will give you the datetime object for the last day of the previous month.

Section 4: Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have seen two ways to get the datetime object of the previous month in Python. The first method uses the datetime module and the second method uses the calendar module. Which method you choose depends on your specific needs and preferences.
