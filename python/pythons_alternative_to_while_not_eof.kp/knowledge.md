tldr: The perfect counterpart in Python for `while not EOF` is `while line in file`.

# Reading a File in Python

To read a file in Python, we typically open it using the `open()` function and then read its contents using a loop. 

Here is an example:

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    line = f.readline()
    while line:
        print(line)
        line = f.readline()
```

In this case, we open the file `"file.txt"` in read mode (`"r"`) and use the `with` statement to ensure that it is properly closed when we're done. We then read the first line of the file using the `readline()` method and enter a loop that continues until the `readline()` method returns an empty string, which indicates that we've reached the end of the file.

Inside the loop, we print the current line and then read the next line using the `readline()` method.

# Using a for Loop to Read a File

Another way to read a file in Python is to use a `for` loop, which automatically iterates over the lines of the file. Here is an example:

```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)
```

In this case, we use the `open()` function to open the file `"file.txt"` in read mode (`"r"`) and use the `with` statement to ensure that it is properly closed when we're done. We then use a `for` loop to iterate over the lines of the file, assigning each line to the variable `line` and then printing it.

This code is equivalent to the previous example, but is slightly more concise and easier to read.

# Conclusion

Python provides several ways to read the contents of a file, including using a `while` loop with the `readline()` method or using a `for` loop to automatically iterate over the lines of the file. Both approaches are simple and effective, and can be used to read files of any size or complexity.
