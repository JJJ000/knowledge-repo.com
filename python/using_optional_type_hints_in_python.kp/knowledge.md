# Overview
The Optional type hint in Python is a way to indicate that a parameter, variable, or function can accept None as a value. This type hint can be used to help document code and provide type checking when using a static type checker such as mypy. 

# Syntax
The Optional type hint is written by adding an 'Optional' type annotation before the type. For example, if you wanted to indicate that a parameter 'x' could accept None as a value, you would write it as 'Optional[int] x'. 

# Benefits
Using the Optional type hint can help document code and make it easier to understand. It can also help with debugging and provide type checking when using a static type checker like mypy. 

# Example
Below is an example of the Optional type hint in use.

```
def add_numbers(x: Optional[int], y: Optional[int]) -> int:
    """
    Adds two numbers together and returns the result.
    """
    if x is None or y is None:
        return None
    return x + y
```
