Section 1: Introduction to sqlite3 module
The sqlite3 module is a lightweight and efficient module in Python that enables you to interact with an SQLite database. SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system. The sqlite3 module allows Python to interact with SQLite databases, allowing you to create, modify, manage, and query databases. 

Section 2: Checking whether sqlite3 module is installed
Before adding the sqlite3 module to Python, it is important to check if it is not installed already. To do that, you can open the Python shell and type `import sqlite3`. If the module is installed, there will be no error message. If the module is not installed, you will get an error message "No module named 'sqlite3'".

Section 3: Installing sqlite3 module
If the sqlite3 module is not installed on your Python environment, you can install it using the pip package manager. To do that, follow these steps:
1. Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (macOS or Linux).
2. Type `pip install pysqlite3` and press Enter. This command will download and install the sqlite3 module on your computer.
3. Wait for a few seconds until the installation process is completed. 

Section 4: Verifying whether sqlite3 module is installed
After installing the sqlite3 module, you can verify that it is installed correctly by typing `import sqlite3` in the Python shell. If there are no error messages, it means that the module is installed correctly and you can start using it to work with SQLite databases in Python.
