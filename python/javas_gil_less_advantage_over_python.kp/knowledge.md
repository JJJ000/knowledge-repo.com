tldr: Java uses threads in a different way that minimizes risk of conflicting data, while Python uses a global interpreter lock to prevent concurrent access to its memory state.

Overview of GIL 

The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mechanism used in some programming languages to ensure that only one thread executes Python bytecode at a time. The GIL is needed because the Python interpreter is not thread-safe, meaning that multiple threads cannot safely execute Python variable operations simultaneously without synchronization. 

Java Virtual Machine's Concurrency Model 

Java Virtual Machine (JVM) uses a different concurrency model than Python. JVM provides multiple threads of control for executing different parts of a program simultaneously. Each thread is scheduled on a separate core of a processor, and the JVM provides coordination mechanisms such as locks, semaphores, and condition variables for synchronizing between threads. Java threads are not required to acquire a global lock to perform variable operations, making it possible for multiple threads to execute Java bytecode simultaneously.

Python's Concurrency Model

Python's concurrency model is different from Java. Python provides the threading module for creating multiple threads of execution within a single interpreter process. These threads can run concurrently, but the GIL ensures that only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time. This significantly limits the ability of Python to exploit multiple processor cores and renders it unsuitable for CPU-bound tasks such as scientific computing, image processing, and numerical simulations.

Why Python Needs GIL? 

Python uses reference counting as its primary method of managing memory. This means that whenever an object is created or destroyed, the interpreter must modify a reference count. The GIL ensures that only one thread can execute bytecodes that modify reference counts at a time, avoiding race conditions that could lead to invalid memory management. Without the GIL, Python's memory-management model would become unworkable, with multiple threads accessing and modifying reference counts simultaneously.

Conclusion 

In conclusion, Python's threading model requires a GIL to avoid conflicts between multiple threads that modify reference counts. Java's concurrency model, by contrast, is designed to allow multiple threads to execute Java bytecode simultaneously, making it possible to take full advantage of multiple processors. While the GIL limits Python's ability to handle computationally intensive tasks, Python's ease of use, interoperability, and vast library ecosystem have made it a popular language for web development, data analysis, and other applications where concurrency is less critical.
