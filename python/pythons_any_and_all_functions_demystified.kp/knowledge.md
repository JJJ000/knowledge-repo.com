tldr: The any() function returns True if at least one element of an iterable is true, while the all() function returns True if all elements of an iterable are true.

## Introduction
Python provides couple of simple yet very useful built-in functions called `any()` and `all()`. These two functions are very handy when working with the collections in python like lists or tuples. These functions accept an iterable object as input argument and returns True or False based on the presence of any True or all True values in the iterable. Let's discuss these two functions in detail:

## The `any()` function
The `any()` function is used to check if any element in an iterable object is True. It takes a single iterable (e.g. list, tuple, dictionary, etc.) as an argument. If at least one element in the iterable object evaluates to true, `any()` returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. Here is an example to demonstrate how to use `any()` function:

```python
>>> lst = [0, False, None, [], (), {}, 1, 'apple']
>>> any(lst)
True
```

In the above example, `any()` function returns `True` because the list `lst` contains at least one element that evaluates to True (i.e. the string 'apple').

## The `all()` function
The `all()` function is also used to check the truthiness of an iterable. However, it checks if all elements in the iterable object are True. If all elements in the iterable evaluate to True, the `all()` function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`. Here is an example to demonstrate how to use `all()` function:

```python
>>> lst = [1, True, 'hi', [4, 5, 6]]
>>> all(lst)
True
```

In the above example, `all()` function returns `True` because all elements in the list `lst` evaluate to True.

## Use cases for `any()` and `all()` functions
These two functions are often used in list comprehensions to filter a list based on certain conditions. For example, if we want to check if a given list contains at least one negative element, we can use the `any()` function like this:

```python
>>> lst = [23, -4, 6, 11, -8, 16]
>>> has_negative = any(num < 0 for num in lst)
>>> has_negative
True
```

Similarly, if we want to check if all elements in a list are of a certain type, we can use the `all()` function like this:

```python
>>> names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Dave']
>>> all(isinstance(name, str) for name in names)
True
```

In the above example, we are using `isinstance()` function to check if each element in the list is a string, and then passing that expression to `all()` function to check if all elements are strings.
