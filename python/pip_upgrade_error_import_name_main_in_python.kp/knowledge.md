### Solution

#### Install the Latest Version of Pip
The first step is to install the latest version of pip. This can be done by running the following command:

`python -m pip install --upgrade pip`

#### Reinstall Packages
The next step is to reinstall any packages that may have been affected by the upgrade. This can be done by running the following command:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

#### Check Python Version
The last step is to check the version of Python you are running. This can be done by running the following command:

`python --version`

If you are running an older version of Python, you may need to upgrade to a newer version in order to resolve the “cannot import name ‘main’” error.

#### Troubleshoot
If the above steps do not resolve the “cannot import name ‘main’” error, you may need to troubleshoot further. This may involve checking for any conflicting packages or modules, as well as checking for any syntax errors in your code.
