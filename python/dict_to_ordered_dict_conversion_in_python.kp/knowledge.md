Section 1: Introduction to Dictionaries and OrderedDict

In Python, dictionaries are a built-in data type that store a collection of key-value pairs. A dictionary is an unordered collection and does not maintain the order of elements. On the other hand, OrderedDict is a subclass of dictionary that maintains the order of elements. 

An OrderedDict is useful in situations where the order of the elements matters, such as when we want to iterate over the elements in a specific order or when we want to maintain the order of insertion of elements.

In this tutorial, weâ€™ll learn how to convert a dictionary to an OrderedDict in Python.

Section 2: Converting a Dictionary to an OrderedDict

To convert a dictionary to an OrderedDict, we first need to import the OrderedDict module from the collections library. 

Then, we can create a new OrderedDict object and pass the existing dictionary as an argument to the constructor of the OrderedDict class. 

Here's the code to convert a dictionary to an OrderedDict:

```
from collections import OrderedDict

my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
ordered_dict = OrderedDict(my_dict)
print(ordered_dict)
```

Output:
```
OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])
```

In the code above, we created a dictionary named `my_dict` and passed it to the constructor of the `OrderedDict` class. We then printed the resulting `ordered_dict` object.

Note that the order of the key-value pairs in the resulting object is in the same order as the original dictionary.

Section 3: Converting a Nested Dictionary to an OrderedDict

In some cases, we might have a nested dictionary that we want to convert to an OrderedDict. In this case, we need to recursively convert each nested dictionary.

Here's an example of how to convert a nested dictionary to an OrderedDict:

```
from collections import OrderedDict

my_dict = {'a': { 'z': 1, 'y': 2}, 'b': 3, 'c': { 'x': 4, 'w': 5}}
ordered_dict = OrderedDict()

for key, value in my_dict.items():
    if isinstance(value, dict):
        ordered_dict[key] = OrderedDict(value)
    else:
        ordered_dict[key] = value

print(ordered_dict)
```

Output:
```
OrderedDict([('a', OrderedDict([('z', 1), ('y', 2)])), ('b', 3), ('c', OrderedDict([('x', 4), ('w', 5)]))])
```

In the code above, we first create an empty `OrderedDict` object. We then iterate over each key-value pair in the original dictionary. 

If the value associated with a key is another dictionary, we recursively convert that dictionary to an `OrderedDict`. If the value is not a dictionary, we simply add the key-value pair to the `ordered_dict` object.

Section 4: Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to convert a dictionary to an OrderedDict in Python. We also saw how to convert a nested dictionary to an OrderedDict using recursion. Using an OrderedDict can be useful in situations where we want to maintain the order of elements.
