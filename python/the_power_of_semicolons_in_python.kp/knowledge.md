## Introduction

In Python, semicolons are typically not necessary to terminate statements. However, there are some cases where semicolons are allowed and even required. In this Python snippet, we will explore why semicolons are allowed and how they are used.

```python
x = 1; y = 2
```

## Multiple statements on one line

In Python, a semicolon can be used to separate multiple statements on a single line. This can be useful in certain situations, such as when writing code golf or when trying to fit code onto a single line for readability purposes.

```python
x = 1; y = 2
```

In this case, the semicolon separates two separate statements that assign values to the variables `x` and `y`.

## Mixing languages

Another use case for semicolons in Python is when you are mixing multiple programming languages in the same file. For example, if you are using a Python script to generate HTML, you may need to use semicolons to terminate JavaScript statements.

```python
print("<script>var x = 1; var y = 2;</script>")
```

In this case, the semicolons terminate two separate JavaScript statements that assign values to the variables `x` and `y`.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, semicolons are allowed in Python in certain situations, such as separating multiple statements on one line or when mixing languages. However, they are not required in most cases and should be used sparingly to maintain the readability and elegance of your code.
