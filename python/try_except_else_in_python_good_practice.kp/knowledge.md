tldr: Yes, it is a good practice to use try-except-else in Python to handle errors gracefully.

**Yes**

1. Readability: 
Using try-except-else makes the code easier to read, as it clearly delineates the code that should be executed in the event of an exception from the code that should be executed in the event of no exception. This makes it easier to debug the code and to understand the logic of the program.

2. Error Handling:
Using try-except-else allows for better error handling, as it allows for the program to gracefully handle exceptions and continue executing, rather than abruptly terminating. This makes the program more robust and reliable.

3. Efficiency:
Using try-except-else can lead to more efficient code, as the code that should be executed in the event of an exception can be put in the except block, rather than having to write an if-else statement to check for an exception.

**No**

1. Complexity:
Using try-except-else can lead to more complex code, as it requires the programmer to think about what should be done in the event of an exception, as well as what should be done in the event of no exception. This can make the code more difficult to understand and debug.

2. Performance:
Using try-except-else can lead to a performance penalty, as the code in the except block will be executed even if there is no exception, leading to unnecessary overhead. This can be avoided by using if-else statements to check for exceptions.
