1. ## When to Use Classes
Classes are used when you want to create a new type of object that can store data and have methods associated with it. Classes are also useful when you want to create a structure for organizing related data and methods.

2. ## Benefits of Classes
Classes are a powerful tool for organizing and managing complex data and code. By using classes, you can create objects that have their own data and methods, which can be used to interact with the data. This makes it easier to manage and understand complex data structures.

3. ## When Not to Use Classes
Classes should not be used when a simpler data structure such as a list or dictionary would suffice. Classes should also not be used when the data and methods associated with the class are not related.

4. ## Alternatives to Classes
If classes are not the right tool for the job, there are other data structures and methods that can be used. For example, dictionaries can be used to store data, and functions can be used to organize related code.
