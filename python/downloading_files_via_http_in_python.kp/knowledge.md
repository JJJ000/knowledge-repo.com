# Section 1: Import Necessary Modules

To download a file over HTTP in Python, the `requests` module must be imported.

```python
import requests
```

# Section 2: Make the Request

An HTTP request must be made to download the file. The `requests.get` method can be used to make the request.

```python
response = requests.get('http://example.com/file.txt')
```

# Section 3: Check Response

The response should be checked to make sure the request was successful. The `response.status_code` property can be used to check the status code of the response.

```python
if response.status_code == 200:
  # Request was successful
else:
  # Request failed
```

# Section 4: Save File

The file can then be saved using the `response.content` property.

```python
with open('file.txt', 'wb') as f:
  f.write(response.content)
```
