#1 Using the open() Function
The open() function is the primary method used to read a file line-by-line in Python. The open() function takes two parameters; the name of the file, and the mode in which to open the file. The mode parameter is optional; if it is not specified, the file will be opened in read-only mode.

#2 Iterating Over the File Object
Once the file is opened, it can be iterated over with a for loop. This will allow each line of the file to be read and processed one at a time.

#3 Closing the File
Once the file has been read, it should be closed to ensure that all resources are released. This can be done using the close() method.

#4 Example
The following example demonstrates how to read a file line-by-line in Python:

with open('myfile.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line)
    f.close()
