tldr: This can be resolved by adjusting the position of the axes label and the twinned axes using the set\_position method.

## Introduction 
Matplotlib is an amazing tool for data visualization, but sometimes the generated plots have some issues with overlapping. One issue is the figure title overlapping with the axes label when using twiny. In this module, we will discuss this issue and examine the most basic method of fixing the issue.

## The issue of title overlapping 
When plotting multiple data sets with shared Y-axis, it is a common practice to create a secondary X-axis. In Matplotlib, this can be achieved by calling the `twinx()` method which creates a new X-axis that shares the Y-axis of the original plot. However, if we add a title for the plot, the title may overlap with the secondary X-axis label, making the plot unreadable.

## Basic solution 
One way to fix this issue is by reducing the font size of the title and secondary X-axis label, which can be achieved using `rcParams` method from the `matplotlib` library. Here's an example code:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()

t = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
s1 = np.sin(t)
ax1.plot(t, s1, 'b-')
ax1.set_xlabel('time (s)')
ax1.set_ylabel('sin', color='b')

ax2 = ax1.twiny()
s2 = np.cos(t)
ax2.plot(t, s2, 'r-')
ax2.set_xlabel('cos', color='r')
ax2.tick_params(axis='x', which='both', labelbottom=False)

plt.title('sin and cos waves')
plt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 12})  # reducing font size

plt.show()
```

In this example, we used the `update()` method of `rcParams` to lower the font size of the title and `set_xlabel()` method of the secondary X-axis to reduce the size of its label. By modifying these settings, we were able to prevent the title from overlapping with the secondary X-axis label. 

## Conclusion 
In this module, we learned about the issue of overlapping between the title and the secondary X-axis label while using Matplotlib's `twiny()` method. We also looked at a basic solution to fix this issue by lowering the font size of the title and secondary X-axis label. However, there are several other ways to address this issue, such as adjusting the subplot spacing or using GridSpec. Using these solutions is dependent upon the visualization needs and data characteristics.
