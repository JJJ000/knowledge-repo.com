[TOC]

1. Compatibility #
PyPy is not compatible with all libraries and frameworks that are available for CPython. It is not compatible with many popular libraries like NumPy and SciPy.

2. Performance #
Although PyPy is 6.3 times faster than CPython, the performance improvement may not be noticeable in many cases. For example, if the application is I/O bound, the performance improvement may be negligible.

3. Memory Usage #
PyPy is generally more memory efficient than CPython, but the difference may not be significant in many cases.

4. Maintenance #
PyPy requires more effort to maintain than CPython. There may be compatibility issues with libraries and frameworks that need to be addressed before deploying an application.
