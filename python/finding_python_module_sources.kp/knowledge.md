tldr: The location of Python module sources can be found in the sys.path list.

**Contents**

[TOC]

1. **Checking the Python Path**

The Python Path is a list of folders where Python looks for modules and packages. To find the location of Python module sources, you can check the Python Path by running the `sys.path` command in the Python interpreter. This will output a list of folders and directories where Python looks for modules.

2. **Using the `pip show` Command**

The `pip show` command can be used to find the location of a specific Python module. This command will output information about the module, including its location.

3. **Using the `importlib.find_loader` Function**

The `importlib.find_loader` function can be used to find the location of a specific Python module. This function takes a module name as an argument and returns a loader object which contains the module's location.

4. **Using the `os.listdir` Function**

The `os.listdir` function can be used to list the contents of a directory. This can be used to find the location of Python module sources by searching for the module in the directories listed in the Python Path.
