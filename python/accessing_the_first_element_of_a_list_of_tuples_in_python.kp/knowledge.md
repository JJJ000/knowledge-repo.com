tldr: To get the first element in a list of tuples in Python, you can use a list comprehension or a for loop with unpacking syntax, such as [x[0] for x in list\_of\_tuples] or for t in list\_of\_tuples first = t[0].

## Introduction
In Python, a list can contain a mixture of different datatypes, including tuples. Tuples are immutable sequences of values, usually with a fixed number of elements. Each element can be of a different datatype. 

If you have a list of tuples and you want to extract the first element from each tuple, you can use the list comprehension technique. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to do that in Python.


## Using List Comprehension
List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. It allows you to iterate over a sequence and apply some operation on each element. In this case, we want to extract the first element of each tuple in a list. Here's an example:

```python
my_list = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]
result = [x[0] for x in my_list]
print(result)
```

Output:
```python
[1, 2, 3]
```

The above code creates a list of tuples called `my_list` containing three tuples. It then extracts the first element of each tuple and stores it in a new list called `result` using list comprehension. Finally, it prints out the `result` list containing the first elements of each tuple.


## Using a For-Loop
Another way to extract the first element of each tuple in a list is to use a for-loop. Here's an example:

```python
my_list = [(1, 'a'), (2, 'b'), (3, 'c')]
result = []

for tup in my_list:
    result.append(tup[0])

print(result)
```

Output:
```python
[1, 2, 3]
```

The above code creates a list of tuples called `my_list` containing three tuples. It then initializes an empty list called `result`. Next, it iterates over each tuple in `my_list` using a for-loop and extracts the first element of each tuple using the indexing `[0]` operator. Finally, it appends each first element to the `result` list and prints it out.


## Conclusion
In summary, we have demonstrated two ways to extract the first element of each tuple in a list in Python. The first approach uses list comprehension, while the second approach uses a for-loop. Both techniques are effective and can be used depending on your use case.
