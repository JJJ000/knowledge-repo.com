Section 1: Introduction
When using Python, it is common to encounter errors during the coding process. One of the most common errors is the ImportError, which occurs when Python cannot import the required module.

Section 2: The Problem 
The ImportError: No module named pandas occurs when the pandas module is not installed or not present in the Python environment. Additionally, this issue can also arise when there is a version conflict with other dependencies.

Section 3: The Solution
To solve the ImportError: No module named pandas error, one must install the pandas module in the Python environment. This can be achieved by running the following command in the terminal or command prompt:
    
    pip install pandas

If you're using version 3 of Python, you can use "pip3" instead:
    
    pip3 install pandas

After the installation, the pandas module can be imported into the Python script without any errors.

Section 4: Conclusion
The ImportError: No module named pandas error can be fixed by installing the pandas module using pip or pip3. It is recommended to always ensure that all required modules are installed and up-to-date to avoid encountering such errors during the coding process.
