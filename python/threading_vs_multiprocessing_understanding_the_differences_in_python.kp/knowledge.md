tldr: The threading module allows multiple threads to share memory within the same process, while the multiprocessing module creates separate processes with their own memory space.

## Overview

Python provides two modules for parallel processing: `threading` and `multiprocessing`, which can run multiple threads or processes simultaneously. However, these modules work differently and have their own advantages and disadvantages. In this article, weâ€™ll explore the main differences between the two.

## Threading

### Definition

`Threading` is a technique of running multiple threads (lightweight execution units) within a process. A thread shares the same memory space as its parent process, and each thread is executed independently.

### Advantages

The `threading` module is lightweight, easy to use, and well-suited for I/O-bound tasks, as threads can release the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) during I/O operations, allowing other threads to run. 

### Disadvantages

The major disadvantage of `threading` is its inability to make full use of multiple CPU cores due to the GIL. This means that CPU-bound tasks may not see a significant improvement in performance.

## Multiprocessing

### Definition

`Multiprocessing`, as the name suggests, is a technique of running multiple processes simultaneously. Each process has its own memory space and can run on a separate CPU core, enabling true parallel processing.

### Advantages

`Multiprocessing` is well-suited for CPU-bound tasks, as it can make full use of multiple CPU cores, resulting in faster execution times. It also allows the use of shared memory and IPC (Inter-Process Communication) mechanisms.

### Disadvantages

The major disadvantage of `multiprocessing` is that it has higher memory overhead than `threading`, as each process has its own memory space. Additionally, the communication between processes can be slower and more complex than communication between threads.

## Conclusion

The `threading` module is well-suited for I/O-bound tasks, while the `multiprocessing` module is more suitable for CPU-bound tasks. Both modules have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of module depends on the specific requirements of a given task. As always, it's important to keep in mind the limitations of each module and to use them appropriately for specific use cases.
