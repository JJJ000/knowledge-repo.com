[TOC]

### `from ... import`
`from ... import` allows you to import specific objects from a module. This syntax allows you to import specific objects from a module, like functions, classes, or variables, without having to import the entire module.

### `import .`
`import .` allows you to import the entire module. This syntax allows you to import the entire module and all of its contents, including functions, classes, and variables.

### Advantages of `from ... import`
The main advantage of using `from ... import` is that it allows you to import only the objects you need, thus reducing the amount of code that needs to be imported and executed. This can help to improve the performance of your code.

### Advantages of `import .`
The main advantage of using `import .` is that it allows you to easily access all of the objects in a module. This can be useful if you need to access multiple objects from the same module.
