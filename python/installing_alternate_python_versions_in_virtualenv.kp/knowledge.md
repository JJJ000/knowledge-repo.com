[TOC]

Yes, it is possible to install another version of Python to Virtualenv. 

### Section 1: What is Virtualenv?

Virtualenv is a tool used to create isolated Python environments that can contain different versions of Python and Python packages. This is especially useful when working on multiple projects with different dependencies.

### Section 2: Installing Another Version of Python to Virtualenv

To install another version of Python to Virtualenv, follow these steps:

1. Install the desired version of Python on your system.
2. In a terminal window, navigate to the directory where you want to create the Virtualenv.
3. Type the following command to create a new Virtualenv with the desired Python version: 

```bash
virtualenv -p /usr/bin/pythonX.X myenv
```

where X.X is the desired Python version and myenv is the name of your Virtualenv.

4. Activate the Virtualenv by typing:

```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

5. You can now use the selected version of Python and install any required packages within this Virtualenv.

### Section 3: Switching Between Virtualenvs

To switch between Virtualenvs with different Python versions, use the `deactivate` command to exit the current Virtualenv and the `source` command to activate the desired Virtualenv.

```bash
# Exit current Virtualenv
deactivate

# Activate desired Virtualenv
source myenv/bin/activate
```

### Section 4: Conclusion

In conclusion, it is possible to install another version of Python to Virtualenv by creating a new Virtualenv with the desired Python version and activating it. Virtualenv allows for multiple isolated environments, making it easier to work on different projects with different dependencies.
