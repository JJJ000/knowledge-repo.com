# Section 1: Define a Serializable Class

A serializable class is one that can be converted into a format, such as JSON, that can be stored and retrieved from a database. To make a class JSON serializable, you must define a class that contains the necessary attributes and methods for serialization.

# Section 2: Implement Serialization Methods

The next step is to implement methods that can be used to convert the class into a JSON-serializable format. This can be done by using the `json` library and defining a `to_json` method that takes the class and returns a JSON string.

# Section 3: Handle Special Data Types

When serializing a class, you may need to handle special data types, such as dates and times. To do this, you can define a `to_json_object` method that takes the class and returns a JSON-serializable object. This object can then be passed to the `json.dumps` method to create a JSON string.

# Section 4: Test Serialization

Once the class is defined and the serialization methods are implemented, it is important to test that the serialization is working correctly. This can be done by creating an instance of the class, serializing it, and then deserializing it to ensure that the data is preserved.
