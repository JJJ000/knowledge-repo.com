# Solution

## Section 1: Overview

The `urllib2` module is not available in Python 3.x. It was available in Python 2.x, but it has been replaced by the `urllib` module in Python 3.x.

## Section 2: Alternatives

The `urllib` module provides most of the same functionality as `urllib2` in Python 3.x, but there are some differences. For example, the `urlopen` function in `urllib` does not support the `data` and `proxies` parameters, which are available in `urllib2`. If you need to use these parameters, you should use the `requests` module instead, which provides a more modern and easier-to-use interface for making HTTP requests.

## Section 3: Installation

The `requests` module is not included in the standard library, so you will need to install it using `pip` or your preferred package manager.

## Section 4: Usage

Using the `requests` module is fairly straightforward. Here is a simple example of how to make a GET request:

```python
import requests

r = requests.get('http://example.com')
print(r.text)
```
