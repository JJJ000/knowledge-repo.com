tldr: Class method decorator with self arguments in Python allows the decorator to modify the behavior of a method when it is called on an instance of a class.

**Contents**

[TOC]

Section 1: Overview of class method decorators
- In Python, decorators are a way to modify the behavior of functions or methods without actually modifying their code.
- Class method decorators are used to modify the behavior of class methods in a similar way.
- Class methods are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance of the class. They usually take the class as their first argument (often referred to as 'cls') instead of the instance (often referred to as 'self').

Section 2: Defining a class method decorator with self arguments
- To define a class method decorator that takes self arguments, we need to define a function that takes two arguments - the decorator arguments and the method to be decorated.
- The first argument should be named 'self' to allow access to the instance of the class.
- The second argument should be named 'cls' to allow access to the class.
- For example:

```
def my_decorator(*args, **kwargs):
    def decorator(method):
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            # do something before the method is called
            result = method(self, *args, **kwargs)
            # do something after the method is called
            return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

Section 3: Using the class method decorator with self arguments
- To use the decorator, we need to apply it to the class method we want to modify.
- We can do this by placing the decorator above the method definition and passing any necessary arguments.
- For example:

```
class MyClass:
    @my_decorator(arg1, arg2)
    def my_method(cls, self, arg3, arg4):
        # method implementation
```

- In this example, 'my_method' is being decorated with 'my_decorator'. 'arg1' and 'arg2' are the decorator arguments.

Section 4: Conclusion
- Class method decorators can be used to modify the behavior of class methods.
- To define a class method decorator that takes self arguments, we need to define a function that takes a 'self' argument and a 'cls' argument.
- To use the decorator, we need to apply it to the class method we want to modify.
