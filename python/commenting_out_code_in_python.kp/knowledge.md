# Syntax for Commenting Out a Block of Code

## Single Line Comments

Single line comments can be created by placing a hash character (#) at the beginning of the line.

```python
# This is a single line comment
```

## Multi-Line Comments

Multi-line comments can be created by enclosing the comment text in triple quotation marks (''' or """).

```python
'''
This is a 
multi-line comment
'''
```
