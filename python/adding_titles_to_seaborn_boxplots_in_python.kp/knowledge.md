## Importing Required Libraries

The first step is to import the necessary libraries required for visualization. We are using Seaborn and Matplotlib for creating boxplots and displaying them.

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Creating a Boxplot

Next, we will create a boxplot using the `boxplot()` method from Seaborn. Here, we are using the `tips` dataset provided by Seaborn. 

```python
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
sns.boxplot(x=tips["total_bill"])
```

## Adding Title to the Boxplot

In order to add a title to the boxplot, we will use the `title()` method from Matplotlib. 

```python
plt.title("Boxplot of Total Bill Amount")
```

## Final Code

The final code would look something like this:
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")
sns.boxplot(x=tips["total_bill"])
plt.title("Boxplot of Total Bill Amount")
plt.show()
```

This will create a boxplot with the title "Boxplot of Total Bill Amount" at the top.
