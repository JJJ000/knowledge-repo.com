[TOC]

#Anaconda
Anaconda is a free and open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing (data science, machine learning applications, large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, etc.), that aims to simplify package management and deployment. It includes a large collection of pre-built and pre-tested packages, and an environment manager called Conda, which makes it easy to manage and deploy multiple versions of software packages and their dependencies.

#Miniconda
Miniconda is a minimal version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages, including pip, zlib and a few others. It is designed to be as small and flexible as possible, and is the recommended choice for users who do not need the full Anaconda distribution. Miniconda can be used to create any number of independent environments containing any combination of Python, packages, and/or command-line tools.
