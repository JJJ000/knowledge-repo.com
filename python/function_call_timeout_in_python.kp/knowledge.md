# Definition
Timeout is a Python module which provides a way to set a limit on the execution time of a function. It works by raising an exception when the time limit is exceeded.

# Usage
Timeout can be used to limit the execution time of a function call. To do this, the timeout decorator is used. The decorator takes a single argument which is the time limit in seconds. The following example shows how to use the timeout decorator to limit the execution time of a function to 5 seconds:

@timeout(5)
def my_function():
    # Do something

# Benefits
Using the timeout decorator can be beneficial in a number of ways. It can help to prevent long-running functions from consuming too many system resources, and it can help to ensure that a function returns within a certain amount of time. This can be useful for ensuring that an API call does not take too long to complete.

# Limitations
The timeout decorator does have some limitations. It is not possible to set a timeout for a block of code, only for a single function call. Additionally, the timeout decorator does not work with asynchronous functions. Lastly, the timeout decorator cannot be used to catch errors that occur within the function.
