#Pip
Pip is a package manager for Python packages, or modules if you like. It is a tool for installing and managing Python packages. It is a package manager that allows you to install and manage software packages written in Python.

#Conda
Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system for installing multiple versions of software packages and their dependencies. It works on Linux, Windows, and MacOS. It is also a cross-platform package manager. Unlike pip, it can be used for managing multiple versions of Python and other packages. It also can create virtual environments and manage them.
