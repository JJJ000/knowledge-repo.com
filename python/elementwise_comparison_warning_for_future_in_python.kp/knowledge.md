tldr: This warning suggests that the current code is performing a scalar comparison instead of an element-wise comparison and that the behavior may change in future Python versions.

Introduction:
This warning is generated when comparing two arrays of different dimensions or comparing two values of the same data types, but unequal sizes. The FutureWarning is a notification informing users that the behavior of a certain function, library, or method may change in the future. In the context of elementwise comparison, the future behavior will compare arrays elementwise rather than returning a scalar value. In this article, we will discuss the cause of the FutureWarning, its impact, and ways to resolve it.

Causes of FutureWarning:
The warning is essentially due to the comparison of two arrays of different shapes. When this occurs, NumPy tries to broadcast the smaller array to have the same shape as the larger array. If the sizes of the arrays do not match, NumPy returns a scalar value rather than comparing the values elementwise. In the future, NumPy will perform elementwise comparisons, leading to a modification of returned output.

Impact of FutureWarning:
This warning affects both new and existing codebases. In the coming years, NumPy will release a version where elementwise comparison would be standard. Therefore, Python-based programs that rely on the present unified scalar return format may encounter issues at several points of the development process. These issues may result in unexpected output, making it difficult to correct such errors.

Ways to resolve FutureWarning:
There are two ways to resolve the FutureWarning issue in Python. One approach is to suppress the warning messages by using the "warnings" module's filter functionality. However, suppressing the warning might miss some vital hints and conceal the actual warning, leading to severe consequences. The other solution to FutureWarning is to adjust the programs' codes to work with arrays of the same shape. If the arrays are of different dimensions, then one must use NumPy broadcasting to make their shape consistent. By making the arrays have the same shape during comparison, the warning can be avoided, and the codebase would continue to work as intended.

Conclusion:
The FutureWarning message is a notification that highlights upcoming changes to elementwise comparisons in NumPy. To ensure maximum compatibility with future versions, users of NumPy should adjust their codes to work with arrays of the same size. Developers should take specific steps to suppress the warning messages, as the suppression might result in missing vital hints that would have helped identify and solve issues.
