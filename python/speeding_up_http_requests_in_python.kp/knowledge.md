#1 Using Threads
Using threads is the fastest way to send 100,000 HTTP requests in Python. Threads allow multiple tasks to run concurrently, which can significantly reduce the time taken to send 100,000 requests. Python's threading module provides a simple and powerful way to create and manage threads.

#2 Using Asyncio
The Python asyncio module provides an efficient way to send 100,000 HTTP requests. Asyncio uses an event loop to manage concurrency and allows multiple tasks to run concurrently. It also provides a number of useful features such as coroutines, which can help reduce the time taken to send 100,000 requests.

#3 Using Multiprocessing
The Python multiprocessing module provides an efficient way to send 100,000 HTTP requests. Multiprocessing allows multiple processes to run concurrently, which can significantly reduce the time taken to send 100,000 requests.

#4 Using a Queue
Using a queue is another efficient way to send 100,000 HTTP requests in Python. A queue allows tasks to be added to a list and processed one at a time, which can significantly reduce the time taken to send 100,000 requests. Python's queue module provides a simple and powerful way to create and manage queues.
