# Possible causes of the error

The "ERROR:root:code for hash md5 was not found" error can occur when using hg mercurial commands in Python. Some of the possible causes of this error include:

- Missing or corrupted hashlib library: If the hashlib library is not installed correctly or is corrupted, it can result in the code for hash md5 not being found.

- Outdated or incompatible Python version: The error can also occur if you are using an outdated or incompatible version of Python that does not support the hashlib library.

- Issue with the mercurial package: If the issue is not related to the Python environment, it is possible that the error is caused by an issue with the mercurial package itself.


# Solutions to the error

To resolve the "ERROR:root:code for hash md5 was not found" error when using hg mercurial commands in Python, you can try the following solutions:

- Reinstall the hashlib library: To fix any issues with the hashlib library, you can try reinstalling it using the appropriate package manager for your operating system. For example, if you are using pip, you can run the command "pip install hashlib".

- Upgrade or reinstall Python: If the issue is related to an outdated or incompatible version of Python, you can try upgrading to a newer version that supports the hashlib library. Alternatively, you can try reinstalling Python to ensure that all necessary packages are installed correctly.

- Reinstall the mercurial package: If the issue is related to the mercurial package, you can try reinstalling it using the appropriate package manager. For example, if you are using pip, you can run the command "pip install mercurial --upgrade".

# Other possible solutions

If the above solutions do not work, there are a few other possible solutions that you can try:

- Check your PATH environment variable: Make sure that the directory containing the hashlib library is included in your PATH environment variable so that Python can find it.

- Disable antivirus software: It is possible that your antivirus software is interfering with the hashlib library. Try disabling it temporarily to see if this resolves the issue.

- Use a different hashing algorithm: If none of the above solutions work, you can try using a different hashing algorithm instead of md5. For example, you can use sha1 or sha256 instead.
