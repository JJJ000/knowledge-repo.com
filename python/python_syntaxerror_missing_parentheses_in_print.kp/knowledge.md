#What is a SyntaxError?
A SyntaxError is an error in the syntax of a program, which means the program cannot understand the code and will not run.

#What is "Missing parentheses in call to 'print'"?
This error occurs when a programmer tries to call the print() function without the required parentheses. The parentheses are necessary to tell the program that the print() function is being called, and without them, the program cannot understand the code.

#What does this mean in Python?
In Python, this error means that the programmer has written code that is missing the parentheses around the print() function. Without the parentheses, the program will not be able to execute the code.

#How can this be fixed?
The programmer can fix this error by adding the parentheses around the print() function. Once the parentheses are added, the program will be able to understand the code and execute it correctly.
