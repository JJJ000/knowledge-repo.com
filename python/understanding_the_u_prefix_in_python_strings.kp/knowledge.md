# Prefix Meaning
The 'u' prefix in a Python string stands for a Unicode string. Unicode is a character encoding standard that supports a wide variety of languages and symbols.

# Unicode in Python
In Python, a Unicode string is a normal string of characters, but it is prefixed with the letter "u." This prefix indicates that the string is a Unicode string, and it allows Python to handle the string correctly when encoding and decoding.

# Benefits of Unicode
Using Unicode strings provides several benefits. Unicode strings are more efficient than standard strings, as they use fewer bytes of memory. Unicode strings are also more reliable than standard strings, as they are less prone to data corruption. Finally, Unicode strings are better suited for internationalization, as they can support a variety of languages and symbols.
