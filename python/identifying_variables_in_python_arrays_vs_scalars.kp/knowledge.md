# Check Type
One way to identify if a variable is an array or a scalar is to check the type of the variable.

In Python, the type of a variable can be checked using the type() function.

For example, if you have a variable x, you can check its type by running type(x).

# Check Value
Another way to identify if a variable is an array or a scalar is to check its value.

If the value of the variable is a list or tuple, then it is an array.

If the value of the variable is an integer, float, string, or boolean, then it is a scalar.

# Check Length
A third way to identify if a variable is an array or a scalar is to check its length.

If the length of the variable is greater than 1, then it is an array.

If the length of the variable is 1, then it is a scalar.
