tldr: Use the `\_\_enter\_\_` and `\_\_exit\_\_` methods of the mock to mock the `with` statement.

1. Introduction
Mocking an open statement used with a with statement may seem tricky. However, with the Mock framework in Python, it can be easily achieved. In this guide, we will walk through the steps required to mock an open statement used in a with statement.

2. Setting up the test
The first step is to set up the test. We will create a test case that has a with statement that uses the open statement. Here is an example:

```python
def test_something(self):
    with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
        # some code here
```

3. Mocking the open statement
Now that we have our with statement set up, we can mock the open statement. To do this, we will use the `mock_open` function provided by the Mock framework. Here is an example:

```python
from unittest.mock import mock_open, patch

def test_something(self):
    with patch('builtins.open', mock_open(read_data="file data")) as mock_file:
        with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
            assert f.read() == "file data"
```

In the above code, we import `mock_open` and `patch` from the `unittest.mock` module. We then use the `patch` decorator to patch the `open` function with the `mock_open` function. We set the `read_data` parameter of `mock_open` to "file data".

With this in place, we can now use the with statement and assert that the data we supplied is returned. Notice that we also pass the `mock_file` object to the with statement. This is important as it allows us to assert that the file was opened and read correctly.

4. Conclusion
Mocking an open statement used in a with statement is easy with the Mock framework in Python. By using the `mock_open` function and the `patch` decorator, we can easily simulate file input and output for our tests.
