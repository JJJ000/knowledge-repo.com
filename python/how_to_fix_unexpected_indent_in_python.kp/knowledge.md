tldr: Ensure that the indentation of your code is consistent and uses only spaces or tabs, not a mixture of them.

## What is "Unexpected indent" in Python?

"Unexpected indent" is an error message that occurs in Python when a block of code is not properly indented. Python relies heavily on whitespace to distinguish between different parts of the code, and an indentation error can cause the code to break or behave unexpectedly.

## How to fix "Unexpected indent" in Python?

There are several ways to fix an "Unexpected indent" error in Python:

### 1. Check the indentation level

The first step is to check whether the indentation level in your code is consistent throughout. Python uses four spaces for indentation, so make sure all your indents follow this standard. It's also important to ensure that the lines of code you want to include in a block have the same level of indentation.

### 2. Use a text editor with indentation support

Some text editors have built-in support for Python indentation, which can help you avoid errors. For example, if you use an editor like Sublime Text or PyCharm, the editor will automatically indent the code for you, making it easier to keep track of the indentation level.

### 3. Highlight the code with incorrect indentation

If your code editor supports syntax highlighting, it's possible to highlight the lines with incorrect indentation. This will make it easier to identify where the issue is and fix it quickly.

### 4. Retype the code with proper indentation

If all else fails, you may need to go through your code and retype it with the proper indentation. This is a time-consuming process, but it's often the most effective way to fix an "Unexpected indent" error.

## How to prevent "Unexpected indent" in Python?

There are several ways to prevent an "Unexpected indent" error from occurring in the first place:

### 1. Use an IDE or code editor with automatic indentation

As mentioned earlier, using an IDE or code editor with automatic indentation can help you avoid unexpected indentation errors. These editors will automatically format your code with proper indentation, making it easier to write clean and readable code.

### 2. Use braces or semicolons for block delimiters

In some languages, such as C++, blocks of code are enclosed in braces. Python does not use braces; instead, it relies on indentation to determine the beginning and end of a block. However, if you're used to using braces, you can use semicolons to separate the end of a line from the start of a new block, which can make it easier to keep track of the indentation.

### 3. Be consistent with your indentation style

Consistency is key in Python. Make sure you use the same indentation style throughout your code, and keep it consistent across all files. This will make it easier to read your code and avoid unexpected errors.

### 4. Use whitespace characters to indicate where your code should be

You can use whitespace characters like tabs or spaces to indicate where your code should be. This will make it easier to read and understand your code, and it will also help you avoid unexpected indentation errors.
