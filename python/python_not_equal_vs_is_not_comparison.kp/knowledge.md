**Operation vs "is not"**

**Definition**

An operation is a process or action that is performed on a set of data or variables. It is typically a mathematical, logical, or Boolean operation. 

"Is not" is a phrase used to indicate that something is not true. It is used to negate a statement or comparison. 

**Examples**

For example, the operation "+" is used to add two numbers together. So, if we have the numbers 3 and 5, the operation "+" would result in the sum 8. 

On the other hand, if we have the statement "This is a cat," the phrase "is not" can be used to negate the statement, resulting in the statement "This is not a cat." 

**Difference**

The main difference between an operation and "is not" is that an operation is used to manipulate data or variables, while "is not" is used to negate a statement or comparison. 

**Conclusion**

In conclusion, an operation is a process or action performed on data or variables, while "is not" is used to negate a statement or comparison.
