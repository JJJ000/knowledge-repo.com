tldr: The Unicode character for the byte order mark (BOM) used to indicate the encoding of a text file.

**Contents**

[TOC]

I. Introduction

In Python, a string can contain any Unicode character, including the special character '\ufeff'. This character is called the Byte Order Mark (BOM), and it is used to indicate the byte order of a Unicode text file.

II. What is the BOM?

The BOM is a Unicode character that is inserted at the beginning of a text file in order to indicate its byte order. This is important because Unicode can be encoded in different ways, such as UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32. Each of these encodings uses a different byte order, which determines how the bytes are stored in memory.

III. Why is the BOM used?

The BOM is used to ensure that a text file is correctly interpreted by software that reads it. If a file is encoded with the wrong byte order, the software may misinterpret the characters in the file, leading to errors or other unexpected behavior.

IV. Conclusion

In summary, the special character '\ufeff' in Python strings is the Byte Order Mark (BOM), which indicates the byte order of a Unicode text file. Although it is not necessary to include the BOM in Python strings, it is sometimes added by software tools or libraries to ensure that text files are correctly interpreted.
