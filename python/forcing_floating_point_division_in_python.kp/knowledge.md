tldr: Use the floor division operator (//) instead of the regular division operator (/) to force division to be floating point.

## Using the float() Function

The `float()` function can be used to convert a number to a floating point number. This can be used to ensure that division operations always return a floating point result.

For example, the following code will ensure that the result of the division operation is a floating point number:

```python
a = 5
b = 2

result = float(a / b)
```

## Using the Decimal Module

The `decimal` module can also be used to ensure that division operations always return a floating point result. This module provides the `Decimal` class, which can be used to represent decimal numbers.

For example, the following code will ensure that the result of the division operation is a floating point number:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

a = Decimal(5)
b = Decimal(2)

result = a / b
```

## Using the Fraction Module

The `fractions` module can also be used to ensure that division operations always return a floating point result. This module provides the `Fraction` class, which can be used to represent fractions.

For example, the following code will ensure that the result of the division operation is a floating point number:

```python
from fractions import Fraction

a = Fraction(5, 1)
b = Fraction(2, 1)

result = a / b
```

## Using the math.trunc() Function

The `math.trunc()` function can also be used to ensure that division operations always return a floating point result. This function will truncate a floating point number to an integer.

For example, the following code will ensure that the result of the division operation is a floating point number:

```python
import math

a = 5
b = 2

result = math.trunc(a / b)
```
