tldr: The current class can be represented as `typing.TypeVar(`CurrentClassName`, bound=object)` in Python return type annotations.

Section 1: Overview

Python is a dynamically typed language which means that the data types of variables and functions can change at runtime. However, sometimes it is useful to have stricter typing and to annotate the return type of a function. In this case, the return type is added as a type annotation to the function definition. In this article, we will discuss how to add the current class as the return type annotation in Python.

Section 2: Using the class name as a string

One way to add the current class as the return type annotation is to use the class name as a string. For example, if we have a class named MyClass, we can annotate the return type of a method in the following way:

```python
class MyClass:
    def my_method(self) -> "MyClass":
        return self
```

In this example, we use the class name as a string to annotate the return type of the my_method method. By doing so, we indicate that the method returns an object of the MyClass class.

Section 3: Using the __class__ attribute

Another way to add the current class as the return type annotation is to use the __class__ attribute. The __class__ attribute is a reference to the class of an object, and it can be used to access the class name. For example, we can annotate the return type of a method using the __class__ attribute in the following way:

```python
class MyClass:
    def my_method(self) -> type(self):
        return self
```

In this example, we use the type(self) expression to access the class of the object and to annotate the return type of the my_method method. By using the __class__ attribute, we avoid having to hardcode the class name as a string.

Section 4: Conclusion

In this article, we discussed two ways to add the current class as the return type annotation in Python. We can either use the class name as a string or access the class name through the __class__ attribute. By annotating return types, we can provide more information about the behavior of functions and make our code more readable and maintainable.
