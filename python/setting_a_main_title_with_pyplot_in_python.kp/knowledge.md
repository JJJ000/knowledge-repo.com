**Section 1 - Setting up the Figure:**

The first step in setting a single, main title above all the subplots with Pyplot in Python is to create a figure object. This can be done using the `plt.figure()` function. This will create a figure object that can be used to add subplots to. 

**Section 2 - Adding Subplots:**

Once the figure object has been created, the next step is to add subplots to the figure. This can be done using the `plt.subplot()` function. This function takes three parameters: the number of rows, the number of columns, and the index of the subplot. 

**Section 3 - Setting the Title:**

Once the subplots have been added, the next step is to set the title of the figure. This can be done using the `plt.suptitle()` function. This function takes a string as an argument, which is the title that will be displayed above all the subplots. 

**Section 4 - Displaying the Figure:**

The final step is to display the figure. This can be done using the `plt.show()` function. This will display the figure with the title set above all the subplots.
