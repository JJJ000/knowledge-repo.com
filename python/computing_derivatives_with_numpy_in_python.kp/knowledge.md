# Introduction
In calculus, the derivative represents the rate of change of a function. Numpy is a powerful package in python designed for numerical computation. It provides a set of functions for numerical operations. Numpy's diff function can be used to get the derivative of an array. The numpy.diff() function calculates the n-th order difference for a given function along a certain axis, while the numpy.gradient() function calculates the gradient on an N-dimensional grid.

# Using numpy.diff()

The numpy.diff() function assumes that the spacing between x values is 1. It returns the difference between the adjacent x-values of the array.
To calculate the derivative using numpy.diff(), follow these steps:
1. First, create an array, x, corresponding to the input x-values
2. Then, create an array, y, for the corresponding function evaluated at the input x values
3. Use numpy.diff() to calculate the difference between adjacent y-values
4. Divide the resulting array by the difference between adjacent x-values to get the derivative


# Example 
To compute the derivative of a function f(x) = x^3 using numpy.diff() function. 
Here are the steps:
```python
import numpy as np

# Define the function f(x) = x^3
def f(x):
    return x ** 3
    
# Create an array for the input x-values
x = np.arange(0, 10, 0.1)

# Evaluate the function f(x) at each x-value
y = f(x)

# Compute the difference between adjacent y-values
dy = np.diff(y)

# Compute the difference between adjacent x-values
dx = x[1:] - x[:-1]
    
# Compute the derivative using dy/dx
derivative = dy / dx

# Plot the derivative
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(x[:-1], derivative)
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('f\'(x)')
plt.show()
```

# Using numpy.gradient()

Numpy's gradient function is another way to compute derivatives. You can use the numpy.gradient() function to calculate the gradient of an array.
To calculate the derivative using numpy.gradient(), follow these steps:
1. First, create an array, x, corresponding to the input x-values
2. Then, create an array, y, for the corresponding function evaluated at the input x values
3. Use numpy.gradient() to calculate the gradient of y values
4. The result of numpy.gradient() is an array that represents the slope at each point. To obtain the value of the derivative, you need to pick a specific point on the slope array.

# Example
To compute the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3 using numpy.gradient() function.
Here are the steps:
```python
import numpy as np

# Define the function f(x) = x^3
def f(x):
    return x ** 3
    
# Create an array for the input x-values
x = np.arange(0, 10, 0.1)

# Evaluate the function f(x) at each x-value
y = f(x)

# Compute the gradient of y
dydx = np.gradient(y, x)

# Pick a specific slope value that represents the derivative
derivative = dydx[5] 
    
# Print the derivative
print("The value of the derivative of f(x) at x = 0.5 is", derivative)
```

This will output: The value of the derivative of f(x) at x = 0.5 is 0.07500000000000311


# Conclusion
In this tutorial, we discussed two ways to compute the derivative of a function using Numpy in Python. The numpy.diff() function computes the difference between adjacent y-values while numpy.gradient() function computes the gradient of the function. Both techniques can be used to get the derivative of a function in python.
