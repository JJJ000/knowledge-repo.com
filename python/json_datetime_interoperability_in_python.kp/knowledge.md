tldr: Python datetime objects can be serialized to JSON strings using the isoformat() method and JavaScript datetime strings can be parsed into Python datetime objects using the fromisoformat() method.

# Python
Python uses the `datetime` module to work with dates and times. This module provides various functions to work with dates and times, such as creating a datetime object from a string, formatting a datetime object into a string, and performing arithmetic operations on datetime objects.

# JavaScript
JavaScript uses the `Date` object to work with dates and times. This object provides various methods to work with dates and times, such as creating a Date object from a string, formatting a Date object into a string, and performing arithmetic operations on Date objects.

# Interoperability
When working with dates and times between Python and JavaScript, it is important to ensure that the date and time data is in a format that is compatible between the two languages. For example, when sending a datetime object from Python to JavaScript, it is important to ensure that the datetime is in a format that is recognized by JavaScript, such as ISO 8601. Similarly, when sending a Date object from JavaScript to Python, it is important to ensure that the Date is in a format that is recognized by Python, such as a string in the ISO 8601 format.

# Conclusion
When working with dates and times between Python and JavaScript, it is important to ensure that the date and time data is in a format that is compatible between the two languages. Python uses the `datetime` module and JavaScript uses the `Date` object to work with dates and times. By ensuring that the date and time data is in a format that is recognized by both languages, it is possible to interoperate between Python and JavaScript when working with dates and times.
