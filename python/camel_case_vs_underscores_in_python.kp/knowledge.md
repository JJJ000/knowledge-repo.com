## Camel Case
Camel case is a style of writing words or phrases in which each word or abbreviation in the middle of the phrase begins with a capital letter, with no intervening spaces or punctuation. It is used in many programming languages, including Python.

## Advantages
Camel case is often preferred because it is easier to read and can make code more organized. Additionally, it allows for easier recognition of class names and variables.

## Disadvantages
Camel case can be difficult to read for some people, especially those who are not used to it. Additionally, it can be difficult to type correctly.

## Underscores
Underscores are used to separate words or phrases in Python. They are often used in place of camel case when a programmer wants to make a particular phrase more legible.

## Advantages
Underscores make code more readable, as they clearly separate words or phrases. Additionally, they can be easier to type than camel case.

## Disadvantages
Underscores can make code less organized, as they can be used to separate words or phrases that are not related. Additionally, some people may find them more difficult to read than camel case.
