# Introduction

The 'module' object is not callable error in Python is a common error encountered when trying to call a module as if it were a function or method. This error is caused by attempting to call a module as if it were a function or method, when in fact it is not.

# Causes

The most common cause of this error is when a module is imported and a function or method is called with the same name as the module. This can happen when a module is imported and the programmer is unaware that the module is already imported.

Another possible cause of this error is if the programmer is trying to call a module as if it were a function or method, when in fact it is not. For example, if the programmer is trying to call a module like this:

```
import mymodule
mymodule()
```

This will cause the 'module' object is not callable error, because the mymodule module is not callable.

# Solutions

The best way to solve this issue is to make sure that modules are not imported more than once, and that functions and methods are not called with the same name as the module.

If the programmer is trying to call a module as if it were a function or method, they should check the documentation to make sure that the module is callable. If the module is not callable, they should use a different method to achieve their desired result.

# Conclusion

This error is caused by attempting to call a module as if it were a function or method, when in fact it is not.
