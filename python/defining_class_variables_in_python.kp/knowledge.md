tldr: Class variables in Python should be declared within the class definition, outside of any methods, using the syntax `variable\_name = value`.

**Contents**

[TOC]

#### Section 1: Declaring Class Variables

Class variables are declared within the class definition, outside of any of the class's methods. They are usually declared at the top of the class, right after the class header.

#### Section 2: Naming Class Variables

Class variables should be named in all lowercase letters, with underscores separating words. This naming convention is the same as for any other variable in Python.

#### Section 3: Assigning Values to Class Variables

Class variables should be assigned a value within the class definition. This can be done by using the assignment operator (=).

#### Section 4: Accessing Class Variables

Class variables can be accessed from within any method of the class. They can also be accessed from outside the class, by using the class name followed by a dot and the variable name.
