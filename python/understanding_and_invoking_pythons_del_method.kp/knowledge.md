tldr: The \_\_del\_\_ method is a special method in Python used for garbage collection and is called automatically when an object is no longer needed or when its reference count reaches zero.

# Definition of __del__ method

In Python, `__del__` is a special method that is used to define the destructor of an object. It is called by Python’s garbage collector when an object is no longer in use or when its reference count becomes zero. 

The `__del__` method can be used to perform cleanup tasks like closing database connections, releasing file locks, releasing network resources, etc. It is important to note that the `__del__` method does not need to be defined explicitly in the class, but can be inherited from the object class.

# Calling the __del__ method

The `__del__` method is automatically called by Python’s garbage collector, which runs periodically to free memory that is no longer in use. Therefore, you do not need to call it explicitly in your code.

However, there are cases where you may want to explicitly delete an object and call its `__del__` method. To do this, you can use the `del` keyword followed by the object’s name. This will remove the object reference and trigger the garbage collection process, which will call the `__del__` method if no other references to the object exist.

```python
class MyClass:
    def __del__(self):
        print("Destructor called")

obj = MyClass()
del obj
```

In the example above, the `__del__` method of the `MyClass` class is defined to print a message when the object is destroyed. The `obj` object is then created and immediately deleted using the `del` keyword. This will call the `__del__` method and print the message "Destructor called" to the console.

# Warning about using the __del__ method

While the `__del__` method can be useful for cleaning up resources, it should be used with caution. The reason for this is that Python’s garbage collector runs periodically and the order in which objects are destroyed is not guaranteed. This can lead to unexpected behavior if an object being destroyed depends on another object that has already been deleted.

Additionally, the `__del__` method can have a negative impact on performance if it is called frequently, as it adds overhead to the garbage collection process. Therefore, it is generally recommended to use other methods like context managers or `with` statements to ensure that resources are properly cleaned up.
