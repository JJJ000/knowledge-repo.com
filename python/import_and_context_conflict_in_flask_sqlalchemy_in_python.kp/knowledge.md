tldr: Import the Flask application instance first, then import the SQLAlchemy instance separately, to avoid circular referencing and context issues.

Introduction
------------
Flask is a micro web framework for Python that can be used for developing small to large size web applications. SQLalchemy is a popular SQL toolkit and ORM framework written in Python. Flask-SQLAlchemy is a Flask extension which provides integration between Flask and the SQLAlchemy library. However, sometimes when using Flask-SQLAlchemy, developers may encounter confusing import/context issues which can be difficult to debug. This article discusses this type of issue and provides possible solutions.

Issue
-----
The issue we are discussing is related to importing the SQLAlchemy object from the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension. Sometimes when importing the db object in a module, an error occurs saying that the SQLAlchemy object has not been initialized. This happens because Flask extensions are initialized in the application context, and during the import of some modules, this context is not yet available.

Solution
--------
The solution to this issue is to ensure that the db object is created within the application context. This can be achieved in several ways, which are discussed below.

#### 1. Using Application Factory Pattern

One way to solve this issue is to use the application factory pattern. This pattern involves creating the Flask application and initializing the extensions inside a function which takes the application configurations as an argument. This ensures that the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension is initialized within the application context. Here is an example of this pattern:

```
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

def create_app(config_name):
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config.from_object(config_name)

    # initialize extension
    db.init_app(app)

    return app
```
In this example, we have created a create_app function that initializes the Flask application and the extension objects in the application context. This allows us to import the db object from within the application code without worrying about the context issue.

#### 2. Creating the DB Object in the Main Application File

Another way to solve this issue is to create the db object in the main application file. In this approach, we can create and initialize the db object after creating the Flask app object. This ensures that the db object is initialized within the application context. Here is an example of this approach:

```
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(config_name)

# create extension object
db = SQLAlchemy(app)
```
In this example, we have created the db object after creating the Flask app object. This ensures that the db object is created in the application context and we can import it without worrying about the context issue.

#### 3. Using Flask current_app Context Proxy

Another way to solve this issue is to use the Flask current_app context proxy. The current_app proxy allows us to use the db object inside a function while ignoring the context issue as it ensures that the object is always called inside the application context. Here is an example of how to use the current_app proxy:

```
from flask import Flask, current_app
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config.from_object(config_name)

db = SQLAlchemy()

with app.app_context():
    db.init_app(current_app)
```
In this example, we are using the with app.app_context() statement to execute the db.init_app(current_app) function inside the application context which ensures that the db object is created in the application context.


Conclusion
----------
In this article, we have discussed the import/context issue that can be encountered when using the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension. We have also provided three possible solutions to solve this issue, including using the application factory pattern, creating the db object in the main application file, and using Flask current_app context proxy. It is good practice to choose the solution that works best for the specific project and to consistently apply that solution throughout the entire application.
