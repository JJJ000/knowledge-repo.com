### Introduction 

Structured Query Language (SQL) is a standard language used to communicate with Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS). SQLite is an open-source RDBMS that provides an easy and lightweight way to store and manage data.

When querying data from an SQLite database in Python, we need to create a cursor object. In this article, we will discuss why a cursor is needed when querying an SQLite database in Python.

### Cursor

A cursor is a temporary work area created in the system memory when a SQL statement is executed. It allows Python to retrieve data from the result set of a SQL query. A cursor enables the user to traverse the rows returned by a SQL query, one row at a time. 

In other words, a cursor is a control structure that enables the user to fetch data from a database in a systematic and organized manner. It provides a pointer to the current row in the result set of a SQL query.

### Execution of SQL Statements

When executing SQL statements against an SQLite database, a cursor is needed to execute the statement and access the results. The database cannot be accessed directly in Python. Therefore, we need to create a cursor to establish a connection with the SQLite database and execute SQL statements. 

Once the cursor is established, we can use it to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on the SQLite database.

### Memory Management

Another reason why a cursor is required when querying an SQLite database in Python is that it helps in managing memory efficiently. SQLite databases can grow very large, and maintaining a large result set in memory can lead to performance issues. 

A cursor helps in minimizing the amount of data loaded into memory at any given time, making it an optimized way to manage memory in a Python SQLite application. 

### Conclusion

In summary, a cursor is essential when querying data from an SQLite database in Python. It enables us to execute SQL statements and retrieve data in a systematic and organized manner. It also helps in managing memory more efficiently, making it an optimized way to work with large datasets.
