tldr: No, global variables are not thread-safe in Flask and to share data between requests in Python, use Flask`s session object or a database.

### Global Variables in Flask

Global variables are not thread-safe in Flask. The reason is that Flask uses a thread-local context, which means that each request is processed in a separate thread. If global variables are used to store data, the data will be shared between all requests, which can lead to race conditions and inconsistencies.

### Ways to Share Data Between Requests

There are several ways to share data between requests in Flask. Here are some common approaches:

#### 1. Session Variables

Sessions allow you to store data on the server-side and associate it with a specific user. Flask provides a built-in session management system that stores data in a cookie or in server-side storage, such as Redis. You can use sessions to store data that needs to be accessed across multiple requests, such as user authentication information or shopping cart items.

#### 2. Database

Another way to share data between requests is to use a database. Flask works well with many popular databases, such as SQLite, MySQL, and PostgreSQL. You can use a database to store data that needs to be persistent across requests, such as user profiles or blog posts.

#### 3. Cache

Caching is a technique that allows you to store data in memory or on disk for faster access in future requests. Flask has support for many caching systems, such as Redis, Memcached, and Flask-Cache. You can use caching to store data that is expensive to compute or retrieve, such as search results or API responses.

#### 4. Application Context

Flask provides an application context that is shared across all requests within the same thread. You can use the application context to store data that needs to be available to all requests, such as configuration settings or database connections.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, global variables are not thread-safe in Flask, and you should avoid using them to share data between requests. Instead, you can use session variables, databases, caching, or the application context to store and share data across requests. Each approach has its own strengths and weaknesses, and you should choose the one that best fits your specific use case.
