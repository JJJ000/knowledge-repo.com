Introduction 
Python package management can be completed with two files requirements.txt and setup.py. Each file has its purpose in the package management process. In this article, we will take a look at the differences between these two files and when to choose one over the other.

What is requirements.txt?
The requirements.txt file is used for specifying the dependencies of a Python project. It contains a list of Python packages that are required to run the project, along with their version numbers. This file can be used with various Package dependency management systems. This file is also essential when sharing or publishing the project, as it ensures that others can install the required dependencies easily.

What is setup.py?
The setup.py file, on the other hand, is used for packaging Python code into a distributable format. It contains metadata about the package such as the name, version, author, and any required dependencies. This file contains the necessary information required by tools like pip to install, build, and distribute the package easily.

When to use requirements.txt?
The requirements.txt file is typically used in development environments to keep track of the project dependencies. It is useful when installing the same dependencies on multiple machines or when sharing the project with other developers. By specifying the dependencies in the requirements.txt file, other developers can install the exact dependencies required by the project, making the code easy to set up and run in a different environment.

When to use setup.py?
In contrast to the requirements.txt file, the setup.py file is used for packaging and distributing Python modules. This file is typically used in production environments where distributing the code to multiple machines is required. By creating a distributable package using setup.py, you can distribute the package easily and ensure that all the dependencies are included with the package.

Conclusion 
In conclusion, both requirements.txt and setup.py files hold great importance in Python package management. While the requirements.txt file is used for recording dependencies, it is particularly useful in development environments. The setup.py file, on the other hand, is used for packaging and distributing modules and is particularly useful in production environments. Knowing the differences between these two files is essential to ensure that you use the right file in the correct environment.
