## Yes

Python can be run on Android through various methods, such as:

1. **Using the QPython App** - QPython is an Android app that allows you to run Python scripts and projects on your Android device. It includes many useful features such as an interactive interpreter, package manager, editor, and debugger.

2. **Using the Pydroid App** - Pydroid is another Android app that allows you to run Python scripts on your Android device. It includes features such as an interactive interpreter, code editor, and debugger.

3. **Using the Termux App** - Termux is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app that allows you to run Python scripts on your Android device. It includes features such as an interactive interpreter, package manager, and code editor.

## No

It is not possible to run Python directly on Android without using an app or emulator. Android does not support the Python language natively, so it must be run through a third-party app or emulator.
