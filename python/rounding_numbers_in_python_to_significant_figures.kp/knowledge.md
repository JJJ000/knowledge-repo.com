tldr: Use the `round()` function with the desired number of digits passed as the second argument, combined with the `math` library`s `log10()` function to calculate the order of magnitude of the number.

## Introducing Significant Figures

Significant figures are digits in a number that are important in terms of precision. For example, the number 12345 has five significant figures, while the number 0.0012 has two significant figures.

Rounding a number to significant figures involves reducing the number to a specified number of digits while preserving the number's value as much as possible. In other words, the rounded number should have the same significance or precision as the original number.

## Round a Number to Significant Figures in Python

To round a number to significant figures in Python, we can use the `round()` function along with some formatting.

### Step 1: Get the Number of Significant Figures

The first step is to determine the number of significant figures that we want to round the number to. This can be specified by the user or calculated based on the number itself.

To calculate the number of significant figures in a number, we can convert it to a string and count the number of non-zero digits from the left. This is the most common method, although there are other methods as well.

For example, if we have the number 0.00345, we can count the digits from the left that are not zero: 3, 4, and 5. Therefore, this number has three significant figures.

### Step 2: Round the Number to the Desired Precision

Once we know the number of significant figures, we can use the `round()` function to round the number to the desired precision. We need to specify the precision using the formatting options available in Python.

For example, if we want to round the number `x` to 3 significant figures, we can use the following code:

``` python
prec = 3 - int(math.floor(math.log10(abs(x)))) - 1
rounded_x = round(x, prec)
```

Here, we calculate the precision needed based on the number of significant figures `n` using the `math` module. We use the `log10()` function to get the number of digits in the number, `floor()` to round down to the nearest integer, `abs()` to get the absolute value of a number, and then subtract 1 and 3 from it to get the precision. Finally, we use the `round()` function to round the number to the calculated precision.

### Step 3: Display the Rounded Number

We can display the rounded number using the `print()` function. We should also format the output to show the correct number of significant figures.

For example, if we want to display the number `rounded_x` rounded to 3 significant figures, we can use the following code:

``` python
print("{:.3g}".format(rounded_x))
```

Here, we use the `format()` function to format the output. The `g` format specifier displays the number with a fixed number of significant figures, which is determined automatically by Python based on the number's size. We use the `:.3` specifier to specify the number of significant figures we want to show, which is 3 in this case. This will display the rounded number with the correct number of significant figures.
