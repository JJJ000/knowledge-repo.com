Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

### Definition 
Java Virtual Machine, or JVM, is a virtual machine that allows Java bytecode to run on different platforms. It is responsible for interpreting and executing the instructions in compiled Java code.

### Features 
- Platform independence: JVM provides platform independence by executing the same bytecode on all operating systems.
- Memory management: JVM automatically manages memory allocation and deallocation for Java applications.
- Security: JVM offers a secure environment for executing Java code by implementing a security manager.
- Portability: JVM provides a high degree of portability, allowing developers to write code once and run it on any platform.

Python Interpreter

### Definition 
Python interpreter is a program that reads Python code and executes it line by line. It is responsible for interpretation and execution of Python code.

### Features 
- Interactive mode: Python interpreter offers an interactive mode, where developers can execute code line by line.
- Dynamic typing: Python interpreter supports dynamic typing, which means developers can assign different data types to the same variable.
- No compilation: Python interpreter does not require code to be compiled before execution.
- Easy to learn: Python interpreter is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it an ideal language for beginners.

### Differences between Java Virtual Machine and Python Interpreter
- Java bytecode runs on the JVM, while Python runs on the interpreter.
- JVM provides platform independence, while Python interpreter does not offer the same level of portability.
- Python interpreter supports dynamic typing, while Java requires explicit data types for all variables.
- Python interpreter is easy to learn and use, while Java requires a more complex understanding of object-oriented programming.
