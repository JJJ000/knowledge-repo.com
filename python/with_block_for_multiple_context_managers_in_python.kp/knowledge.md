# Introduction
Python has a feature called context managers, which are used to manage resources that are acquired and released in a particular way. To manage multiple resources at once, Python allows the use of a 'with' block with multiple context managers. In this tutorial, we'll learn how to create a 'with' block on several context managers in Python.

## Section 1: Using multiple context managers
To create a 'with' block on several context managers, we need to use the built-in 'with' statement. The 'with' statement allows us to execute code within a context and handle exceptions and cleanup after the context is no longer needed. When using multiple context managers, we can simply separate them with commas inside the 'with' block.

```python
with context_manager_A(args_A), context_manager_B(args_B):
    # code to execute in the context of A and B
```

## Section 2: Example usage
Here is an example of using multiple context managers in a 'with' block. In this example, we are opening a file, writing some data to it, and then compressing it using gzip.

```python
import gzip

with open('file.txt', 'w') as file, gzip.open('file.txt.gz', 'wb') as f_out:
    file.write('Hello, world!')
    f_out.write(bytes('Hello, world!', 'utf-8'))
```

In this example, we open the file using the built-in 'open' function and pass the 'w' parameter to open it for writing. We also specify the file name as 'file.txt'. This creates a context in which we can write to the file.

We then create another context by calling the gzip.open() function and passing 'wb' as the mode (write binary). We specify the compressed file name as 'file.txt.gz'. This creates a second context in which we can write compressed data.

Finally, we write some data to the file using the 'write' method of the file object and the 'write' method of the gzip object.

## Section 3: Conclusion
By using multiple context managers in a 'with' block, we can manage several resources at once and ensure that they are properly released after use. This is a powerful feature of Python that can help us write more efficient and reliable code.
