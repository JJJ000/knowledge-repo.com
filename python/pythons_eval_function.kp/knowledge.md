# Overview

Python's `eval()` function evaluates a string as a Python expression and returns the result. It is a powerful function that can be used for a variety of tasks, such as executing dynamic code, evaluating mathematical expressions, and more.

# Syntax

The syntax for the `eval()` function is as follows:

```python
eval(expression, globals=None, locals=None)
```

Where `expression` is a string containing a valid Python expression. The optional `globals` and `locals` parameters can be used to specify the global and local variables that should be available when `eval()` is called.

# Examples

The following examples demonstrate how `eval()` can be used:

```python
# Evaluate a mathematical expression
result = eval('2 + 3')
print(result) # Outputs 5

# Execute a dynamic code
dynamic_code = 'print("Hello World!")'
eval(dynamic_code) # Outputs "Hello World!"
```

# Security

It is important to note that `eval()` should be used with caution, as it can be used to execute malicious code. It is recommended to only use `eval()` on trusted input from sources that you trust.
