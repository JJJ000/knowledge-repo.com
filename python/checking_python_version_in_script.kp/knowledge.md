# Check Version of Python Interpreter

## Method 1: sys.version

The easiest way to check the version of Python running your script is to use the `sys.version` command. This command will print out the version of Python that is currently running your script. 

## Method 2: sys.version_info

Another way to check the version of Python is to use the `sys.version_info` command. This command will print out a tuple containing the version information of the currently running Python interpreter.

## Method 3: platform.python_version()

The `platform.python_version()` command is another way to check the version of Python running your script. This command will return a string containing the version of the Python interpreter.
