tldr: When working with Python graphics, a warning about too many open figures usually indicates that a script has opened many figures but has not closed them, which could lead to memory-related errors or a slowdown in performance.

## Introduction

Python is a popular language for data analysis and visualization tasks. However, when working with matplotlib or other plotting libraries, you may encounter a warning about too many open figures. This warning indicates that you have opened too many plots without closing them, which can lead to performance issues and memory leaks.

In this article, we will explore the causes of this warning and provide some tips on how to avoid it in your Python code.


## Understanding the warning

When you use matplotlib or other plotting libraries in Python, each plot you create is opened in a new window or pane. If you create many plots without closing them, you may run out of memory or experience a slowdown in your Python environment.

To avoid these issues, matplotlib will issue a warning if you have too many open figures. The warning message will look something like this:

```
UserWarning: Matplotlib is currently using xx open figures, which is more than the recommended amount of yy. This may result in performance issues or memory leaks.
```

The warning message tells you how many open figures you have and how many figures are recommended. You can adjust the recommended limit with the `matplotlib.rcParams['figure.max_open_warning']` setting.


## Causes of too many open figures

There are several reasons why you may be opening too many figures in your Python code. Some common causes include:

- Not closing figures: If you create a figure but do not explicitly close it with `plt.close()` or `fig.close()`, it will remain open and count towards your open figure limit.
- Multiple plots in a loop: If you create a plot inside a loop, you may be creating a new figure for each iteration of the loop, leading to many open figures.
- Recursive functions: If you have a recursive function that creates a plot, you may be creating many open figures without realizing it.


## Tips for avoiding the warning

To avoid the warning about too many open figures, you can follow these tips:

- Explicitly close figures: Whenever you are done with a figure, make sure to explicitly close it with `plt.close()` or `fig.close()`. This will remove it from memory and free up resources.
- Reuse figures: If you need to create multiple plots, try to reuse the same figure by using `plt.figure()` or `plt.subplots()` with the `reuse=True` argument.
- Avoid multiple plots in a loop: If you need to create a plot inside a loop, try to reuse the same figure or use a subplot instead of creating a new figure for each iteration.
- Avoid recursive functions with plots: If you need to create a plot in a recursive function, consider passing the figure or axes object as an argument instead of creating a new one each time.


## Conclusion

The warning about too many open figures in Python can be a useful reminder to close figures and free up resources. By following the tips in this article, you can avoid this warning and ensure that your Python code runs smoothly and efficiently.
