# Introduction
Python Debugger, also known as pdb, is a built-in tool to debug Python code. It allows you to pause the execution of the code, inspect variables, and step through the code line by line. It is a very useful tool for finding and fixing errors in your Python code. However, it can be tedious to manually start the debugger every time an error occurs. In this guide, we will explore ways to automatically start the debugger on error.

# Using try-except block
One way to start the debugger automatically on error is to use a try-except block. In this approach, you wrap the code that might raise an exception in a try block and catch the exception in an except block. In the except block, you can call the pdb.set_trace() method to start the debugger. Here is an example:

```
import pdb

try:
    # code that might raise an exception
except Exception as e:
    pdb.set_trace()
```

This approach works well for small programs where you can easily identify the potential sources of errors. However, for larger programs, it can be difficult to identify which code block is causing the error.

# Using the command-line option
Another way to start the debugger automatically on error is to use the -m option with the Python command. This way, you can start the debugger for any Python program without modifying the code. Here is an example:

```
python -m pdb your_program.py
```

This will run your_program.py and start the pdb debugger automatically if an error occurs. Again, this approach is useful for larger programs where it can be difficult to identify the source of the error.

# Using an IDE
Most modern IDEs come with built-in support for debugging. They allow you to set breakpoints in the code, step through the code line by line, and inspect variables. Additionally, many IDEs automatically start the debugger on error. For example, in PyCharm, you can enable the "Break at first line in Python scripts" option to automatically start the debugger when you run a Python script. Similarly, in Visual Studio Code, you can use the "Debug > Add Configuration" option to create a launch configuration that starts the debugger automatically on error.

# Conclusion
There are several ways to start the pdb debugger automatically on error. Depending on the size and complexity of your program, you can use a try-except block, the command-line option, or an IDE. Use the one that works best for your needs and helps you identify and fix errors in your Python code.
