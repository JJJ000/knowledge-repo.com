tldr: Use a boolean expression with all() that checks whether each key is in the dictionary.

Section 1: Introduction
In Python, we often need to check if multiple keys are present in a dictionary. There are multiple ways to achieve this, but in this article, we will discuss the most efficient and Pythonic way to check multiple keys in a single pass without using the `for` loop.

Section 2: Using `all()` function
The easiest and most Pythonic way to check multiple keys in a dictionary is by using the `all()` function along with `in` operator. The `all()` function returns `True` if all the elements of an iterable are true, and the `in` operator checks if a particular key is present in the dictionary or not. We can use these two together to check if multiple keys are present in a dictionary at once.

Here's the Python code to check if multiple keys are in a dictionary:

```
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
required_keys = ['name', 'age']
if all(key in my_dict for key in required_keys):
  print("All keys are present!")
else:
  print("Some keys are missing!")
```

In the above code, we have a dictionary `my_dict` containing the information about a person, and we want to check if the `name` and `age` keys are present in this dictionary. We create a list `required_keys` containing the keys we want to check, and then use `all()` along with `in` inside an `if` statement to check if all the keys are present or not.

Section 3: Using `set()` Intersection
Another way to check multiple keys in a dictionary is by converting the keys of the dictionary and the required keys into sets, and then performing an intersection of these sets. If the resulting intersection has the same number of elements as the set of required keys, then all the required keys are present.

Here's the Python code to check if multiple keys are in a dictionary using `set()` intersection:

```
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
required_keys = ['name', 'age']

if set(my_dict.keys()).intersection(required_keys) == set(required_keys):
  print("All keys are present!")
else:
  print("Some keys are missing!")
```

In the above code, we first convert the keys of the dictionary `my_dict` into a set using the `set()` function. We then perform an intersection of this set with the set of `required_keys`. If the resulting set has the same number of elements as the set of `required_keys`, that means all the required keys are present in `my_dict`.

Section 4: Conclusion
In this article, we have discussed two Pythonic ways to check if multiple keys are present in a dictionary. We can use the `all()` function along with `in` operator, or we can convert the keys of the dictionary and the required keys into sets and perform an intersection of these sets. Both solutions are efficient and Pythonic. However, the `all()` function solution is more readable and intuitive, and it requires less code.
