### Using Triple Quotes

Python allows for multiline comments using triple quotes.  Single or double quotes can be used for the triple quotes.  The comment will start after the opening triple quotes and end before the closing triple quotes.

Example:
```
"""
This is a multiline comment.
It can span multiple lines.
"""
```

### Using Hash (#)

Python also allows for multiline comments using the hash (#) character.  Each line of the comment must begin with a hash character.  The comment will end when the next line of code is encountered.

Example:
```
# This is a multiline comment.
# It can span multiple lines.
```
