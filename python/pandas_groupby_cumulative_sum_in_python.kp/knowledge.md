tldr: To calculate the cumulative sum of a specific column in a pandas dataframe using groupby function in Python, use the cumsum() method within the parentheses of the groupby() method.

Section 1: Introduction

Pandas is a powerful Python library that provides flexible and efficient data structures for data analysis. One of the most commonly used functions in Pandas is `groupby()`, which groups a DataFrame by one or more columns and allows you to apply aggregate functions to each group. In this tutorial, we will discuss how to perform a cumulative sum on a grouped DataFrame using Pandas.

Section 2: Grouping a DataFrame

To perform a cumulative sum on a grouped DataFrame, we first need to group the DataFrame by one or more columns. We can use the `groupby()` function to do this. Here's an example:

``` python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')
grouped_df = df.groupby(['Region', 'Year'])
```

In this example, we have read in a CSV file called `sales_data.csv` and created a new DataFrame called `df`. We then use the `groupby()` function to group the data by `Region` and `Year`, creating a new DataFrame called `grouped_df`.

Section 3: Performing a Cumulative Sum

Once we have a grouped DataFrame, we can perform a cumulative sum on each group using Pandas' `cumsum()` function. We can apply this function to a specific column or to the entire DataFrame. Here's an example:

``` python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')
grouped_df = df.groupby(['Region', 'Year'])

cumulative_sum = grouped_df['Sales'].cumsum()
```

In this example, we have used the `cumsum()` function to calculate the cumulative sum of the `Sales` column for each group in the `grouped_df` DataFrame. The result is a new Series called `cumulative_sum`.

Section 4: Adding a Cumulative Sum Column to the DataFrame

Finally, we can add the calculated cumulative sum to the original DataFrame as a new column using Pandas' `assign()` function. Here's an example:

``` python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')
grouped_df = df.groupby(['Region', 'Year'])

cumulative_sum = grouped_df['Sales'].cumsum()

df = df.assign(Cumulative_Sales=cumulative_sum)
```

In this example, we have used the `assign()` function to add the `cumulative_sum` Series to the original DataFrame as a new column called `Cumulative_Sales`. The resulting DataFrame `df` now contains the cumulative sum of the `Sales` column for each group, and we can use it for further analysis or visualization.
