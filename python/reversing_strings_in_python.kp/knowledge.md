tldr: You can reverse a string in Python by using the slicing syntax to reverse the order of the characters in the string.

## Using a For Loop

The following code uses a `for` loop to iterate through the string, and then adds each character to a new string in reverse order:

```python
def reverse_string(s):
  reversed_string = ""
  for char in s:
    reversed_string = char + reversed_string
  return reversed_string
```

## Using a Slice

The following code uses a slice to reverse the string:

```python
def reverse_string(s):
  return s[::-1]
```

## Using the `reversed()` Function

The following code uses the `reversed()` function to reverse the string:

```python
def reverse_string(s):
  return ''.join(reversed(s))
```

## Using the `join()` and `reversed()` Method

The following code uses the `join()` and `reversed()` method to reverse the string:

```python
def reverse_string(s):
  return ''.join(list(reversed(s)))
```
