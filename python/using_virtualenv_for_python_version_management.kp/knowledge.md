[TOC]

# Section 1: Overview

Virtualenv is a tool used to create isolated Python environments. It allows you to create separate environments for different projects and switch between them easily. With virtualenv, you can use different versions of Python for different projects, allowing you to work with the version that best suits your needs.

# Section 2: Installing Virtualenv

Installing virtualenv is easy and can be done with the following command:

```
$ pip install virtualenv
```

# Section 3: Creating a Virtual Environment

Once virtualenv is installed, you can create a virtual environment with the following command:

```
$ virtualenv <env_name> --python=<python_version>
```

The `<env_name>` argument is the name of the environment you want to create, and the `<python_version>` argument is the version of Python you want to use.

# Section 4: Activating the Virtual Environment

Once the virtual environment is created, you can activate it with the following command:

```
$ source <env_name>/bin/activate
```

This will activate the virtual environment and you will be able to use the specified version of Python.
