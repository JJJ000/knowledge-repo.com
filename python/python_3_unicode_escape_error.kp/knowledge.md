tldr: The `unicodeescape` codec can`t be used to open text files in Python 3, so a different encoding must be used.

# Introduction
Python 3 is a powerful programming language that allows users to write code that can interact with a variety of data types and file formats. In particular, Python 3 can open text files and read their contents. However, if the text file is encoded in a non-standard format, such as Unicode, then Python 3 may encounter errors when attempting to open the file.

# Unicode Error
When attempting to open a text file encoded in Unicode, Python 3 may encounter a "unicodeescape" codec error. This error occurs when Python 3 attempts to decode the bytes of the text file using the default encoding of the system, which is usually UTF-8. If the text file is encoded in a different format, such as UTF-16, then Python 3 will not be able to decode the bytes correctly and will encounter an error.

# Solutions
Fortunately, there are a few solutions to this problem. The first is to manually specify the encoding of the text file when opening it. This can be done by passing the encoding parameter to the open() function. For example, if the text file is encoded in UTF-16, then the following code can be used to open the file: 

```python
with open('my_file.txt', encoding='utf-16') as f:
    contents = f.read()
```

Another solution is to use the codecs module to open the file. The codecs module allows users to specify the encoding of the text file when opening it. For example, if the text file is encoded in UTF-16, then the following code can be used to open the file:

```python
import codecs
with codecs.open('my_file.txt', encoding='utf-16') as f:
    contents = f.read()
```

# Conclusion
In summary, Python 3 can open text files and read their contents. However, if the text file is encoded in a non-standard format, such as Unicode, then Python 3 may encounter errors when attempting to open the file. Fortunately, there are a few solutions to this problem such as manually specifying the encoding of the text file when opening it or using the codecs module.
