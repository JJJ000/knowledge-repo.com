# Section 1: Business Logic

Business logic is the core of any application. It is the code responsible for handling data, performing calculations, and making decisions. In Django, business logic is typically written in Python code and stored in the models.py file. This code is responsible for defining the data structure and the methods used to manipulate and query that data.

# Section 2: Data Access

Data access is the code responsible for interacting with the data store. In Django, this is typically done through the use of the Django ORM (Object-Relational Mapper). This code is responsible for creating, reading, updating, and deleting data from the database. It is also responsible for defining the relationships between different models.

# Section 3: Separation of Concerns

The separation of business logic and data access is important in order to ensure that the code is maintainable and extensible. By keeping the business logic and data access code separate, it is easier to make changes to one without affecting the other. This also makes it easier to test the code, as it can be tested in isolation.

# Section 4: Benefits

Separating business logic and data access in Django has several benefits. It allows the code to be more modular, making it easier to debug and maintain. It also makes it easier to scale the application, as the business logic and data access code can be changed independently. Finally, it makes it easier to reuse code, as the business logic and data access can be used in multiple applications.
