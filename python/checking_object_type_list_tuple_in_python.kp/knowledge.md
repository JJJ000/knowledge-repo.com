tldr: Use the `type()` function to check if the object is a list or tuple, but not a string.

# Section 1: Using type()

The `type()` function can be used to check the type of an object. To check if an object is a list or tuple, we can use the `type()` function to check if the object is of type `list` or `tuple`.

# Section 2: Using isinstance()

The `isinstance()` function can also be used to check the type of an object. To check if an object is a list or tuple, we can use the `isinstance()` function to check if the object is an instance of `list` or `tuple`.

# Section 3: Using issubclass()

The `issubclass()` function can also be used to check the type of an object. To check if an object is a list or tuple, we can use the `issubclass()` function to check if the object is a subclass of `list` or `tuple`.

# Section 4: Using len()

The `len()` function can also be used to check the type of an object. To check if an object is a list or tuple, we can use the `len()` function to check the length of the object. If the length of the object is greater than 0, then it is likely a list or tuple.
