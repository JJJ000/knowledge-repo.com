tldr: Use the Requests library in Python to post the login credentials to the appropriate form fields, and then use the returned cookies in subsequent requests.

# Section 1: Installing Required Libraries

To use Python for web scraping, we need to install some essential libraries. We can install them using pip or Anaconda. Here, we need two libraries to login to a webpage and retrieve cookies.

1. requests - to send HTTP requests and get responses.
2. BeautifulSoup - to extract data from HTML files.

We can install these libraries by running the following commands in a command prompt or terminal:

```
pip install requests
pip install beautifulsoup4
```


# Section 2: Logging in and Retrieving Cookies

Now, let's write some Python code to log in to a webpage and retrieve cookies. For example, I am going to use the Stack Overflow website for this purpose.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

#login credentials
username = 'your_username'
password = 'your_password'

#url for login page
login_url = 'https://stackoverflow.com/users/login/'

# create a session object
session = requests.Session()

# get the login page
response = session.get(login_url)

# parse the login page using BeautifulSoup
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

# extract the form data
form = soup.find('form', {'id': 'login-form'})
inputs = form.find_all('input')

# create a payload dictionary with form data
payload = {i.get('name'): i.get('value') for i in inputs}
payload['email'] = username
payload['password'] = password

# send a post request to login
post_response = session.post(login_url, data=payload)

# check if login was successful
if 'Welcome back!' in post_response.text:
  # print cookies
  print(session.cookies.get_dict())
else:
  print('Login failed.')
```

Let's understand the code. Firstly, we define the login credentials (i.e., username and password) for the webpage we want to log in to. Next, we define the login URL of the webpage we want to log in to. 

We create a session object from the requests library package. This session object is a cookie jar that will store the cookies obtained from the webpage after logging in. 

Then, we get the login page using the session object and parse it using the BeautifulSoup library. We extract the form data from the parsed HTML and create a payload dictionary with this form data. We replace the payload dictionary with our login credentials. 

Finally, we send a POST request to login to the website with the payload dictionary's credentials. If the login was successful, we print out the cookies stored in the session object. Otherwise, we print "Login Failed".


# Section 3: Using the Cookies for Next Requests

We can use the cookies obtained from the session object to access pages that need authentication. Let's see an example of how to use the cookies for making authenticated requests.

```python
#url for authenticated page
url = 'https://stackoverflow.com/users/account-info/'

# create headers for requests
headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.125 Safari/537.36',
    'Referer': login_url
}

# send a get request with the session's cookies
response = session.get(url, headers=headers)

# print the response
print(response.text)
```

In this code snippet, we define the URL of the page that we want to access, '/users/account-info/' in this case. 

We create custom headers for the request containing login credentials. We then send a GET request to the URL using the session object and cookies obtained from our previous login. Finally, we print out the HTML response to the screen.


# Section 4: Conclusion

With this, we end this tutorial on how to use Python to login to a webpage and retrieve cookies for later usage. We learned about two essential libraries, requests and BeautifulSoup, and how to use them to login to a webpage and retrieve cookies. We also saw an example of how to use these cookies and access authenticated pages using Python. With this knowledge, you can automate your web-scraping workflow and save time.
