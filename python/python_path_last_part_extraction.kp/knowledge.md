[TOC]

## Section 1: Using os.path

The `os.path` module provides a number of useful functions for manipulating file paths. One of these functions is `os.path.basename()`, which returns the last part of a file path.

For example, if you have the following file path:

```
/home/user/Documents/myfile.txt
```

You can use `os.path.basename()` to get only the last part of the path:

```python
import os

file_path = "/home/user/Documents/myfile.txt"

last_part = os.path.basename(file_path)

print(last_part)
# Output: myfile.txt
```

## Section 2: Using Pathlib

The `pathlib` module provides an object-oriented approach to working with files and directories. The `Path` class provides a `name` attribute that can be used to get the last part of a file path.

For example, if you have the following file path:

```
/home/user/Documents/myfile.txt
```

You can use the `name` attribute to get only the last part of the path:

```python
from pathlib import Path

file_path = Path("/home/user/Documents/myfile.txt")

last_part = file_path.name

print(last_part)
# Output: myfile.txt
```

## Section 3: Using String Manipulation

You can also use string manipulation techniques to get the last part of a file path. For example, if you have the following file path:

```
/home/user/Documents/myfile.txt
```

You can use the `split()` method to split the path into a list of strings and then get the last element of the list:

```python
file_path = "/home/user/Documents/myfile.txt"

parts = file_path.split("/")
last_part = parts[-1]

print(last_part)
# Output: myfile.txt
```

## Section 4: Using Regular Expressions

You can also use regular expressions to get the last part of a file path. For example, if you have the following file path:

```
/home/user/Documents/myfile.txt
```

You can use the `re.search()` method to search for the last part of the path:

```python
import re

file_path = "/home/user/Documents/myfile.txt"

match = re.search(r"/([^/]+)$", file_path)
last_part = match.group(1)

print(last_part)
# Output: myfile.txt
```
