# Creating a Constant in Python

## Step 1: Assign a Value
The first step in creating a constant in Python is to assign a value to it. This can be done by creating a variable and assigning a value to it.

## Step 2: Make the Variable Immutable
The next step is to make the variable immutable. This can be done by using the keyword `const` before the variable name when declaring it.

The final step is to assign the variable to a module. This can be done by using the `globals()` function. This will make the variable available to the module and any code that imports the module.
