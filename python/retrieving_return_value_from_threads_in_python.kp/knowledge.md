# Section 1: Using the Threading.Event Class
The Threading.Event class is a synchronization primitive that can be used to wait for a thread to finish and get its return value. To use this method, you must first create an Event object and pass it to the thread. The thread can then call the set() method on the Event object when it is finished executing and return its value. The main thread can then call the wait() method on the Event object to block until the thread completes and return the value.

# Section 2: Using the Queue Module
The Queue module can be used to communicate between threads and get the return value from a thread. To use this method, you must first create a Queue object and pass it to the thread. The thread can then put the return value in the queue and the main thread can get the value from the queue.

# Section 3: Using a Global Variable
A global variable can be used to get the return value from a thread. To use this method, you must first declare a global variable and pass it to the thread. The thread can then set the global variable to the return value and the main thread can access the global variable to get the return value.

# Section 4: Using a Callback Function
A callback function can be used to get the return value from a thread. To use this method, you must first define a callback function and pass it to the thread. The thread can then call the callback function with the return value and the main thread can access the return value from the callback function.
