tldr: You can filter objects for count annotation in Django using the filter() method in the queryset, and then use the annotate() method to count the number of objects that match the filter criteria.

## Problem Description

Django provides a powerful ORM that allows us to interact with databases using Python classes. One of the most common operations is counting objects in a queryset, and Django provides the `count()` method for this purpose. However, sometimes we need to count only a subset of objects that match certain criteria, and we want to do it efficiently. In this case, we can use the `filter()` method to apply conditions to the queryset before counting. In this tutorial, we will see how to use `filter()` for count annotation in Django.

## Solution

### Step 1: Create a Django project and app

We assume that you have already installed Django on your system. If not, please follow the official Django documentation to install it. Then, create a new Django project and app using the following commands:

```bash
$ django-admin startproject myproject
$ cd myproject
$ python manage.py startapp myapp
```

### Step 2: Create a model

Let's create a simple model for our app `myapp`. Open the `models.py` file in your app directory and define a model as follows:

```python
from django.db import models

class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    author = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    published_date = models.DateField()
    is_published = models.BooleanField(default=False)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title
```

This model represents a book with a title, author, publication date, and a flag indicating whether the book is published or not.

### Step 3: Create some sample data

Let's create some sample data using Django's interactive shell. Run the following command to start the shell:

```bash
$ python manage.py shell
```

Then, import the `Book` model and create a few objects:

```python
from myapp.models import Book
from datetime import date

b1 = Book(title='The Catcher in the Rye', author='J.D. Salinger', published_date=date(1951, 7, 16), is_published=True)
b1.save()

b2 = Book(title='To Kill a Mockingbird', author='Harper Lee', published_date=date(1960, 7, 11), is_published=True)
b2.save()

b3 = Book(title='The Great Gatsby', author='F. Scott Fitzgerald', published_date=date(1925, 4, 10), is_published=False)
b3.save()

b4 = Book(title='One Hundred Years of Solitude', author='Gabriel García Márquez', published_date=date(1967, 6, 5), is_published=True)
b4.save()
```

These objects represent books with various publication dates and publication statuses.

### Step 4: Use filter for count annotation

Now, let's use the `filter()` method to get a count of books that were published before 1950:

```python
from django.db.models import Count
older_books_count = Book.objects.filter(published_date__lt=date(1950,1,1)).count()
print(f'There are {older_books_count} books published before 1950')
```

In this code, we first import the `Count` aggregation function from `django.db.models`. Then, we apply the `filter()` method to the `Book` queryset, passing it a criterion that selects only books with a publication date before January 1st, 1950. Finally, we apply the `count()` method to the filtered queryset to get the number of books that match the criterion. We store the count in a variable called `older_books_count`.

When we run this code, we should see the following output:

```bash
There are 1 books published before 1950
```

This means that only one book in our sample data meets the criterion of publication before 1950.

### Step 5: Use filter with annotation for count annotation

Alternatively, we could use the `annotate()` method to add a count of older books as a calculated field to the queryset. We do this by chaining the `annotate()` method after `filter()`, passing it an argument that specifies the aggregation function we want to apply (`Count`) and the name of the field we want to create. Here's how we can do it:

```python
older_books_annotated = Book.objects.filter(published_date__lt=date(1950, 1, 1)).annotate(count=Count('id'))
for book in older_books_annotated:
    print(f"{book.title} has a count of {book.count} of books published before 1950")
```

In this code, we apply `filter()` method with a condition of selecting books before 1950. Then filtered objects are annotated with `Count` based on the `id` attribute of the model. Lastly, this annotated queryset is looped over to get the title of the book and count of books published before 1950.

When we run this code, we should see the following output:

```bash
The Catcher in the Rye has a count of 1 of books published before 1950
```

This means that the only book in our sample data that was published before 1950 is "The Catcher in the Rye", and it has only one copy in our collection.

## Summary

Counting objects in Django using `filter()` method helps to get a subset of objects based on certain criteria i.e we can apply filtration based on multiple fields, date ranges, etc. By using an annotation in a filter query, we can add a calculated field to the queryset that includes a count of objects that meet the criteria. With these ways, we can get the count of objects as required.
