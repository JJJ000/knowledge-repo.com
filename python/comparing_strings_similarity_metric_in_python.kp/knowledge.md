[TOC]

#1 Jaccard Similarity
Jaccard similarity is a metric that measures the similarity between two strings. It is calculated by taking the size of the intersection of two sets divided by the size of the union of the two sets. 

#2 Cosine Similarity
Cosine similarity is a metric that measures the similarity between two strings. It is calculated by taking the dot product of two vectors divided by the product of their magnitudes. 

#3 Hamming Distance
Hamming distance is a metric that measures the difference between two strings. It is calculated by counting the number of positions in which the two strings differ. 

#4 Levenshtein Distance
Levenshtein distance is a metric that measures the difference between two strings. It is calculated by counting the minimum number of operations (insertions, deletions, and substitutions) needed to transform one string into another.
