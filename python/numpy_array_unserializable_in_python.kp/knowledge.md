# Introduction

NumPy is a powerful and popular library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a powerful array object that is used for high-performance numerical computing. However, NumPy arrays are not JSON serializable, meaning they cannot be converted into JSON format. This can be a problem when trying to exchange data between different systems.

# What is JSON?

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular data-interchange format used for exchanging data between different systems. It is a lightweight, text-based, language-independent data format that is easy for humans to read and write. JSON is also used for serializing and transmitting structured data over a network connection.

# Why is NumPy Not JSON Serializable?

The main reason why NumPy arrays are not JSON serializable is due to the fact that they are not natively supported by the JSON standard. NumPy arrays are not natively supported by the JSON standard because they are not a primitive data type. Primitive data types such as strings and numbers are natively supported by the JSON standard, while complex data types such as NumPy arrays are not.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, NumPy arrays are not JSON serializable, meaning they cannot be converted into JSON format. This can be a problem when trying to exchange data between different systems. However, there are ways to work around this limitation, such as using the jsonpickle library or converting the NumPy array into a list before serializing it.
