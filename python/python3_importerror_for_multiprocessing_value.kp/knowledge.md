# Background

The `multiprocessing` module in Python allows for spawning processes to run parallel to the main program. One feature of this module is the ability to share memory between processes using the `Value` class.

# Problem

When attempting to use the `Value` class in the `multiprocessing` module, an error may occur: `ImportError: No module named '_ctypes'`. This error indicates that the `_ctypes` module is not available on the system.

# Solution

The `_ctypes` module is a part of the Python standard library, but it may not be installed or available on some systems. To resolve this issue, ensure that the `libffi-dev` library is installed on the system.

On Ubuntu/Debian:

```
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
```

On Fedora/CentOS:

```
sudo yum install libffi-devel
```

After installing the `libffi-dev` library, re-install the Python interpreter and re-run the program.

# Conclusion

The `ImportError: No module named '_ctypes'` error in Python when using the `Value` class from the `multiprocessing` module can be resolved by installing the `libffi-dev` library and re-installing the Python interpreter.
