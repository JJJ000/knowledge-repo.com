## Condition for overriding save method

The first step in overriding the save method for a Django model only in certain cases is to identify the conditions under which it should be overridden. This could be based on the object being saved, certain fields or values in the object, or the user performing the save action. 

## Implementing logic in save method

Once the conditions for overriding the save method have been identified, the next step is to implement the logic in the save method. This could involve changing certain fields or values in the object, performing additional actions before or after saving the object, or preventing the save action altogether. 

## Using signals

In some cases, it may not be appropriate to override the save method directly. Instead, a better approach could be to use signals to perform additional actions before or after the save method is called. For example, the pre_save signal could be used to perform some additional validation on the object before it is saved. 

## Testing

Finally, it is important to thoroughly test the updated save method to ensure that it behaves as expected in all cases. This could involve writing unit tests to check that the logic is correct and integration tests to ensure that the updated save method works correctly with other parts of the application.
