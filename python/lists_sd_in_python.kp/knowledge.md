## 1. What is Standard Deviation?
In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion in a set of data values. It essentially measures how far apart the data points are from the mean of the data set. The formula for calculating standard deviation is:

Where xÌ„ is the mean of the data set, xi is each individual data point, and n is the total number of data points.

## 2. How to Calculate Standard Deviation in Python?
Python has a built-in statistics module that provides several functions for calculating basic statistical measures, including the standard deviation. The module's `stdev()` method can be used to calculate the standard deviation of a list of numbers in Python. 

Here is an example of how to use the `stdev()` method:

```python
import statistics

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

std_dev = statistics.stdev(data)

print(std_dev) # Output: 1.5811388300841898
```
In this example, we first import the statistics module, create a list of data, and then call the `stdev()` function on the list to calculate the standard deviation. The result is then printed to the console, which should output 1.5811388300841898.

## 3. Handling Empty List and Lists with One Element
It is important to note that if the list passed to the `stdev()` method is empty or contains only one element, it will result in a `StatisticsError`. To avoid such errors, you should always ensure that the list has at least two elements before calling the `stdev()` method.

Here is an example of how to handle empty list and lists with one element:

```python

import statistics

data1 = []  # Empty list
data2 = [1]  # List with one element

if len(data1) < 2:
    print("Error: List must have at least two elements")
else:
    std_dev1 = statistics.stdev(data1)
    print(std_dev1)

if len(data2) < 2:
    print("Error: List must have at least two elements")
else:
    std_dev2 = statistics.stdev(data2)
    print(std_dev2)
```

In this example, we check the length of the two lists before calling the `stdev()` method. If the length is less than 2, we print an error message. Otherwise, we calculate the standard deviation and print the result to the console.
