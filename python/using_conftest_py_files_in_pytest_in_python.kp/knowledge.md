# Fixtures
Fixtures are functions that are used to set up and tear down a test environment. They can be used to create test data, set up test dependencies, and provide other necessary resources for tests. The conftest.py file allows fixtures to be shared among multiple test files. 

# Plugins
The conftest.py file can also be used to store plugins. Plugins are used to extend pytestâ€™s functionality. The conftest.py file allows plugins to be shared among multiple test files. 

# Customizations
