# Introduction

In Python, there are different ways to create module-wide variables. Module-level variables are those that are accessible throughout a module, including all its functions and classes.

This tutorial will cover some of the ways to create module-wide variables, including using global variables, assigning attributes to modules, and using the __all__ attribute to control what gets exported.

# Global Variables

One way to create module-wide variables is to use global variables. In Python, a variable declared outside of any function or class is a global variable. Global variables are accessible throughout the module, including all its functions and classes.

Here is an example of using global variables to create module-wide variables:

```
# module.py

_pi = 3.14  # Global variable

def circle_area(radius):
    return _pi * radius ** 2
```

In this example, `_pi` is a global variable that is accessible to the `circle_area` function. This allows us to create a module-wide variable that can be used by all functions within the module.

# Assigning Attributes to Modules

Another way to create module-wide variables is by assigning attributes to modules. In Python, modules are objects, and we can assign attributes to modules just like we can assign attributes to other objects.

Here is an example of assigning attributes to modules to create module-wide variables:

```
# module.py

import math

module_variable = 42
math_module_variable = math.pi
```

In this example, we are assigning the value `42` to `module_variable`, and the value of `math.pi` to `math_module_variable`. These variables can be accessed from any function within the module just like any other attribute of the module.

# Using the __all__ Attribute

Finally, we can use the `__all__` attribute to control what variables are exported from a module. In Python, when we import a module, we only import the variables that are explicitly listed in the `__all__` attribute, if it exists.

Here is an example of using the `__all__` attribute to create module-wide variables:

```
# module.py

__all__ = ['module_variable', 'math_module_variable']

module_variable = 42
math_module_variable = math.pi
```

In this example, we are setting the `__all__` attribute to a list of the variables we want to export from the module. In this case, we are exporting `module_variable` and `math_module_variable`. Any variable that is not listed in the `__all__` attribute will not be exported and will be considered private to the module.

# Conclusion

In Python, there are different ways to create module-wide variables, including using global variables, assigning attributes to modules, and using the `__all__` attribute to control what gets exported. Global variables are accessible throughout the module, while attributes assigned to modules can be accessed just like any other module attribute. The `__all__` attribute can be used to control what variables are exported from the module.
