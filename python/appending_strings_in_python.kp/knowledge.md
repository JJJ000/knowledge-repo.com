### Using the Plus Operator
The plus operator (+) can be used to append one string to another. This method works by adding the strings together, similar to how it is used for mathematical addition.

Example:

```
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"

string3 = string1 + string2

print(string3)
```

Output:

```
HelloWorld
```

### Using the Join Method
The join() method can also be used to append one string to another. This method works by joining all strings in a given iterable (such as a list or tuple).

Example:

```
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"

string3 = " ".join([string1, string2])

print(string3)
```

Output:

```
Hello World
```

### Using the Format Method
The format() method can also be used to append one string to another. This method works by formatting a given string with the values of any given variables.

Example:

```
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"

string3 = "{} {}".format(string1, string2)

print(string3)
```

Output:

```
Hello World
```

### Using the f-Strings
f-strings can also be used to append one string to another. This method works by formatting a given string with the values of any given variables.

Example:

```
string1 = "Hello"
string2 = "World"

string3 = f"{string1} {string2}"

print(string3)
```

Output:

```
Hello World
```
