### Syntax 
Lists are defined using square brackets [], while tuples are defined using parentheses (). 

### Mutability
Lists are mutable, meaning that they can be changed after they are created. Tuples are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed after they are created. 

### Accessing Elements
Both lists and tuples can be indexed to access specific elements.

### Usage
Lists are typically used when the order of the elements is important and when the elements may need to be changed. Tuples are typically used when the order of the elements is important and when the elements will not need to be changed.
