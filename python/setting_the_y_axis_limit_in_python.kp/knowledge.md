# Setting Y-Axis Limit

## Method 1: Using Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python used to create 2D graphs and plots. It is possible to set the y-axis limit in Matplotlib by using the set_ylim() function. The syntax for this function is as follows:

```
ax.set_ylim(ymin, ymax)
```

Where ax is the axes object and ymin and ymax are the lower and upper limits of the y-axis respectively.

## Method 2: Using Seaborn
Seaborn is a library for creating statistical graphics in Python. It is possible to set the y-axis limit in Seaborn by using the set_ylim() function. The syntax for this function is as follows:

```
ax.set_ylim(ymin, ymax)
```

Where ax is the axes object and ymin and ymax are the lower and upper limits of the y-axis respectively.

## Method 3: Using Pandas
Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It is possible to set the y-axis limit in Pandas by using the set_ylim() function. The syntax for this function is as follows:

```
ax.set_ylim(ymin, ymax)
```

Where ax is the axes object and ymin and ymax are the lower and upper limits of the y-axis respectively.

## Method 4: Using Plotly
Plotly is a library for creating interactive data visualizations in Python. It is possible to set the y-axis limit in Plotly by using the set_ylim() function. The syntax for this function is as follows:

```
ax.set_ylim(ymin, ymax)
```

Where ax is the axes object and ymin and ymax are the lower and upper limits of the y-axis respectively.
