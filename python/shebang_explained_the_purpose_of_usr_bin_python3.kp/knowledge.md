# Purpose of #!/usr/bin/python3 shebang

The `shebang` or `hashbang` line defines the interpreter to be used to execute a script. In the case of `#!/usr/bin/python3`, it specifies the location of the Python 3 interpreter to use. Here are some of the reasons why it is important to use shebang:

## Specify the interpreter to be used

When a script is run, the `shebang` line tells the operating system which interpreter should be used to execute the script. It is used to specify the location of the Python interpreter on the system. This is especially important when multiple versions of Python are installed on a system.

## Make the script executable

In order to execute a Python script, it must be made executable. This can be done with the `chmod` command. The `shebang` line also makes the script executable even without explicitly specifying the interpreter.

## Ensure cross-platform compatibility

The `shebang` line is used on Unix-like systems such as Linux and macOS. Windows does not use `shebang` lines, but Python scripts can still be run on Windows through the use of `file associations`.

## Conclusion

In summary, the `#!/usr/bin/python3` shebang is important in specifying the interpreter to be used, making the script executable, ensuring cross-platform compatibility, and more. It is a crucial element in running Python scripts on various systems.
