tldr: Function annotations can be used to provide information about the types of function parameters and return values, improving code readability and maintainability.

## 1. Type Checking

One of the primary uses of function annotations in Python3 is type-checking. By using annotations to specify the expected types for function arguments and return values, you can help catch type-related errors at runtime. This can save you time and effort in debugging, as well as helping to ensure that your code is functioning properly.

For example, you might annotate a function that takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum like this:

```python
def add_numbers(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y
```

In this case, we're indicating that the `x` and `y` arguments should be integers, and that the function should return an integer. If someone tries to call this function with non-integer arguments, or if the function returns something that's not an integer, Python will raise an error at runtime.

## 2. Documentation

Another common use for function annotations is to provide documentation for your functions. By including annotations that describe the expected types and meanings of arguments and return values, you can make it easier for other developers (and yourself) to understand how to use the function correctly.

For example, you might annotate a function that calculates a person's age based on their birth year like this:

```python
def calculate_age(birth_year: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate a person's age based on their birth year.
    
    Arguments:
    birth_year -- the year the person was born (an integer)
    
    Returns:
    an integer representing the person's age in years
    """
    current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year
    return current_year - birth_year
```

In this case, we're using annotations to describe the expected argument and return value types, as well as providing a docstring that explains what the function does and how to use it.

## 3. Decorators

Function annotations can also be used to implement decorators, which are a way of modifying the behavior of functions or classes. For example, you might create a decorator that logs information about how long a function took to execute:

```python
import time

def timing_decorator(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start_time = time.time()
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end_time = time.time()
        print(f"{func.__name__} took {end_time - start_time:.2f} seconds to execute")
        return result
    return wrapper

@timing_decorator
def my_function():
    # ... do some expensive calculation
    pass
```

In this case, we're using a function annotation (`func`) to indicate that `timing_decorator` is a decorator that takes a function as an argument. The decorator itself is defined as a nested function that takes `*args` and `**kwargs` as arguments (which allow it to accept any number and type of arguments), and returns a new function (`wrapper`) that wraps the original function (`func`). The wrapper function invokes the original function, records the time it took to execute, and returns the result. Finally, the decorator returns the wrapper function, which can be used to modify other functions by prepending the `@timing_decorator` annotation.
