# Advantages of Pip

1. More Flexible: Pip is more flexible than easy_install in terms of the packages it can install. It can install packages from PyPI and other indexes, as well as from version control repositories like GitHub and Bitbucket.

2. More Secure: Pip has a more secure installation process than easy_install. It checks the packageâ€™s digital signature and checksum before installing it, so it can detect if a package has been tampered with.

# Disadvantages of Easy_Install

1. Limited Package Sources: Easy_Install can only install packages from PyPI, so it is limited in the packages it can install.

2. Lack of Security: Easy_Install does not check the digital signature or checksum of the package before installing it, so it is vulnerable to malicious packages.
