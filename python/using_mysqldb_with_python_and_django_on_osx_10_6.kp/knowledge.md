## Installing MySQLdb

To use MySQLdb with Python and Django in OSX 10.6, you need to install the MySQLdb Python module. Follow these steps to install MySQLdb:

1. Install MySQL on your OSX machine if you haven't already done so. You can download the MySQL DMG file from the official MySQL website.
2. Install MySQLdb using pip, the Python package manager. Open the Terminal app in OSX and type the following command:

   ```
   sudo pip install MySQL-python
   ```

   This will download and install the MySQLdb module.

## Configuring Django to use MySQLdb

After installing MySQLdb, you need to configure your Django project to use MySQL as the database backend. Follow these steps to configure Django:

1. In your Django project's `settings.py` file, locate the `DATABASES` setting.
2. Change the `ENGINE` setting to `'django.db.backends.mysql'`.
3. Add the `USER`, `PASSWORD`, `HOST`, and `PORT` settings to match your MySQL server's configuration:

   ```python
   DATABASES = {
       'default': {
           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
           'NAME': 'mydatabase',
           'USER': 'mydatabaseuser',
           'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
           'HOST': 'localhost',
           'PORT': '3306',
       }
   }
   ```

   Replace `mydatabase`, `mydatabaseuser`, and `mypassword` with your MySQL database name, username, and password, respectively. If your MySQL server is running on a remote machine, change the `HOST` setting to the remote machine's IP address or hostname.

4. Run the Django development server to ensure that Django can connect to your MySQL database. In the Terminal app, navigate to your Django project's root directory and run the following command:

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   If everything is configured correctly, the development server should start up without errors.

## Using MySQLdb in Python code

Once you have installed MySQLdb and configured Django to use it, you can use MySQLdb in your Python code. Follow these steps to use MySQLdb:

1. Import MySQLdb at the top of your Python file:

   ```python
   import MySQLdb
   ```

2. Use the `connect()` method of the `MySQLdb` module to connect to your MySQL database:

   ```python
   db = MySQLdb.connect(
       host="localhost",
       user="mydatabaseuser",
       passwd="mypassword",
       db="mydatabase"
   )
   ```

   Replace `mydatabaseuser` and `mypassword` with your MySQL database username and password, respectively. If your database is running on a remote machine, replace `localhost` with the remote machine's IP address or hostname.

3. Use the `cursor()` method of the database connection object to create a cursor object, which you can use to execute MySQL queries:

   ```python
   cursor = db.cursor()
   cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM mytable")
   results = cursor.fetchall()
   for row in results:
       print(row)
   ```

   In this example, `mytable` is the name of the MySQL table you want to query. The `fetchall()` method of the cursor object returns a list of tuples, where each tuple corresponds to a row in the query result. 

4. After you're done with your database connection, close it to free up system resources:

   ```python
   db.close()
   ```

With these steps, you can successfully use MySQLdb with Python and Django on OSX 10.6.
