# Introduction

Python is a popular programming language used for many different applications. As with other programming languages, Python has a number of syntax rules, including the use of '//' for certain operations.

# Purpose of '//'

The '//' symbol is used in Python as a floor division operator. This operator divides two numbers and returns the integer value of the quotient. For example, 5 // 2 will return 2, as 5 divided by 2 is 2.5 and the integer value of 2.5 is 2.

# Other Uses

The '//' symbol is also used to indicate a comment in Python. Comments are lines of code that are not executed by the interpreter. They are used to explain code and can be used to temporarily disable code.

# Summary

The '//' symbol is used in Python for floor division and for indicating comments. Floor division returns the integer value of the quotient when two numbers are divided, and comments are lines of code that are not executed by the interpreter.
