### __init__

The __init__ method is a special method of a class in Python. It is called when an instance of the class is created. It is used to set up or initialize the attributes of the class and its objects.

### __call__

The __call__ method is also a special method of a class in Python. It is called when an instance of the class is called as a function. It allows the class to behave like a function and can be used to define custom behavior for when the object is called.
