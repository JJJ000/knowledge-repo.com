tldr: Numpy arrays are multi-dimensional arrays that can store elements of any data type, while matrices are two-dimensional arrays that can only store elements of the same data type. For most applications, it is recommended to use numpy arrays in Python.

**Contents**

[TOC]

1. **Shape and Dimensionality**
Numpy arrays have a shape and dimensionality that is determined by the number of elements in the array. Matrices, on the other hand, have a fixed shape and dimensionality. 

2. **Operations**
Numpy arrays are better suited for performing element-wise operations, while matrices are better suited for performing matrix operations. 

3. **Memory**
Numpy arrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory, while matrices are stored in a two-dimensional array. 

4. **Which to Use**
Numpy arrays are better suited for performing mathematical operations on large datasets, while matrices are better suited for performing linear algebra operations.
