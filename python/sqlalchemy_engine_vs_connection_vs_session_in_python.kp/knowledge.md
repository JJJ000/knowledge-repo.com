tldr: The engine creates a connection pool while connection establishes a connection to the database and the session manages database transactions in SQLalchemy.

## Introduction

SQLAlchemy is a SQL toolkit and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for Python. It provides a set of high-level APIs that makes it easy to interact with relational databases within Python, so that developers can focus on their application code. In this article, we will explore three important components of SQLAlchemy: engine, connection, and session.

## Engines

The SQLAlchemy engine is the core component that interacts directly with the database. It provides a source of connectivity to a particular database management system such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or Oracle. It is responsible for managing the connection to the database and maintaining a connection pool to minimize the overhead of opening new connections. An engine can be created using the create_engine() function.

```python
    from sqlalchemy import create_engine
    engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@hostname/database')
```

## Connections

The SQLAlchemy connection represents a real-time communication channel to the database. It provides a context for executing SQL statements and retrieving results. Connections are acquired from the engine using the connect() method or by calling the method on a connection URL directly. Once the work is done, the connection is closed, either manually or automatically. 

```python
    from sqlalchemy import create_engine
    engine = create_engine('postgresql://user:password@hostname/database')
    connection = engine.connect()
```

## Sessions

The SQLAlchemy session provides a high-level interface for managing transactions and ORM interactions. It is a container for all the necessary information to interact with a database, including connection information and transaction states. A session can be used as a context manager or returned explicitly from a session factory.

```python
    from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker
    Session = sessionmaker(bind=engine)
    session = Session()
```

## Conclusion

In summary, SQLAlchemy provides three important components to interact with relational databases in Python â€“ engine, connection, and session. Engines provide a source of connectivity to the database management system. Connections represent a real-time communication channel to the database, while sessions provide a high level of abstraction for managing transactions and ORM interactions. Understanding these components helps developers to build robust and efficient applications that interact with databases.
