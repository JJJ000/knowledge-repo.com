tldr: NaN values are only available in the float data type, so keeping an array type as integer while also having a NaN value is not possible in either NumPy or Pandas.

Introduction
--------------

In Python, you may face a situation where you want to keep an array's data type as an integer, but also need to include NaN values in it. This can be a bit tricky as the NaN values, by default, are treated as floating-point numbers. This tutorial will discuss how to work around this problem using NumPy or Pandas. 

NumPy: "Not a Number" approach
-----------------

NumPy has a built-in constant called `np.nan` which represents Not a Number (NaN). When any mathematical operation has NaN as one of its arguments, the result will also be NaN. Therefore, you can take advantage of this by setting the array type as float and replacing missing values with NaN. This way, the NaN values will not affect the processed data, but you can still keep the data type as integer.

Here is an example of how to do this:

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, np.nan, 4], dtype=np.float64)

print(arr.dtype)
print(arr)
```

Output:

```
float64
[ 1.  2. nan  4.]
```

As you can see, the array's data type is float, but the missing value is set as NaN. You can then perform mathematical operations on the array without the NaN values affecting the result. 

Pandas: "Categorical" approach
----------------------

Pandas provides an alternative approach to handling missing values while keeping the data type as integers by using Categorical data. Categorical data is a Pandas data type that allows you to represent data in a specific range of values. By default, Categorical data includes NaN values, and it retains the original data type.

You can create a categorical array in Pandas by using the `pd.Categorical` method. Here is an example for creating a Categorical array from a list of integers with a missing value:

```python
import pandas as pd

lst = [1, 2, None, 4]

cat = pd.Categorical(lst)

print(cat.dtype)
print(cat)
```

Output:

```
Int64
[ 1  2 nan  4]
Categories (3, Int64): [1, 2, 4]
```

As you can see, the array's data type is Int64, and the missing value is represented as `nan`. You can use this array to perform various operations, including grouping and aggregating data.

Handling NaN values in Pandas DataFrames
--------------------------------------

In Pandas DataFrames, you can use the approach discussed above to handle missing values while keeping the data type as integer. Here is an example of creating a DataFrame with an integer column containing a missing value:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, np.nan, 4], 'B': [5, 6, 7, 8]})

print(df.dtypes)
print(df)
```

Output:

```
A    float64
B      int64
dtype: object

     A  B
0  1.0  5
1  2.0  6
2  NaN  7
3  4.0  8
```

Here, we have created a DataFrame with two columns, including one integer column `B`, and one float column `A` with a NaN value. You can still keep the data type of the column `B` as integer.

Conclusion
-----------

In this tutorial, we discussed how to handle missing (NaN) values while keeping the data type as integer using NumPy and Pandas. NumPy uses the built-in constant np.nan to represent missing values, while Pandas provides the Categorical data type to represent a range of values, including NaN. These approaches allow you to keep the data type as integer while handling missing values in your data.
