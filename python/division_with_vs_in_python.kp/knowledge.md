**'/' Operator**
The '/' operator is the standard division operator in Python 3. It performs what is known as "true division" and will always return a float value.

**'//' Operator**
The '//' operator is a floor division operator in Python 3. It performs what is known as "floor division" and will always return an integer value. This operator rounds the result down to the nearest whole number.
