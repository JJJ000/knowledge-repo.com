## Introduction
Flask is a lightweight web application framework written in Python. Flask by default uses a single threaded development server, so the number of concurrent requests that a single Flask process can receive depends on various factors such as web server, operating system, CPU cores, and RAM capacity.

## Factors affecting the number of concurrent requests
There are several factors that can impact the number of concurrent requests a Flask process can handle:

### Web server
The choice of web server that Flask is running on will impact the number of concurrent requests the web application can handle. Several popular web servers like Gunicorn, uWSGI, and mod_wsgi can run Flask applications and process concurrent requests more efficiently.

### Operating System 
The operating system plays a significant role in determining the number of concurrent requests a Flask process can receive. The process handling model of the operating system like Linux, macOS, and Windows can impact how efficiently Flask executes with multiple incoming requests.

### CPU cores
CPU cores also affect the number of concurrent requests that a Flask application can handle. Flask applications can benefit from having multiple CPU cores as each core can process an individual request.

### RAM capacity
Finally, the RAM capacity of the server also affects the number of concurrent requests that a Flask process can handle. When processing multiple concurrent requests, Flask needs sufficient RAM to handle incoming requests, process application logic, and store data.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, it is difficult to determine the exact number of concurrent requests that a Flask process can receive as it depends on various factors like the web server, operating system, CPU cores, and RAM capacity. A Flask application running on a powerful web server on a highly optimized and well-equipped operating system can handle a vast number of concurrent requests, while a Flask application running on an under-powered server may struggle to process even a few incoming requests.
