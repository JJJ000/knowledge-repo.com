tldr: Yes, the command `pip show [package name]` can display information about the package, including its dependencies.

Section 1: Introduction
Dependency trees are a crucial aspect of software management. In Python, pip is the standard package manager used to install and manage third-party packages. However, sometimes it is necessary to know the dependency trees associated with these packages. This article explores ways to show dependency trees for pip packages in Python.

Section 2: Using pipdeptree
One of the ways to show the dependency trees for pip packages in Python is by using the pipdeptree package. This package provides a command-line interface that shows the dependency tree for each installed package. To use pipdeptree, first, you have to install it using pip.

```
pip install pipdeptree
```

Once pipdeptree is installed, run the following command:

```
pipdeptree
```

This command shows the dependency tree for each installed package in a tree-like structure. The package name is at the root of the tree, and its dependencies are shown as nodes below it.

Section 3: Using pip_show_dependencies
Another way to show dependency trees for pip packages in Python is by using the pip_show_dependencies package. This package provides a function that retrieves the dependencies for a specific package. To use pip_show_dependencies, install it using pip:

```
pip install pip_show_dependencies
```

Once installed, you can use the following code to display the dependency tree for a package:

```
from pip_show_dependencies.tree import build_dependency_tree

tree = build_dependency_tree('package_name')
print(tree)
```

This code displays the dependency tree for the specified package. The output is a tree-like structure that lists the package and its dependencies.

Section 4: Conclusion
In conclusion, dependency trees are crucial for software management, and sometimes it is necessary to view the dependency trees for pip packages in Python. Two ways of doing this are by using pipdeptree and pip_show_dependencies packages, which both provide a tree-like structure of each package's dependencies. These functions are useful for debugging, testing and maintaining Python code.
