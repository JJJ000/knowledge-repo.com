#### Converting a Character to an Integer

Python offers several methods for converting a character to an integer.

1. Using the `ord()` Function: The `ord()` function takes a single character as an argument and returns its corresponding ASCII code (integer). For example, `ord('A')` returns 65.

2. Using the `int()` Function: The `int()` function can be used to convert a character to an integer. For example, `int('5')` returns 5.

#### Converting an Integer to a Character

Python offers several methods for converting an integer to a character.

1. Using the `chr()` Function: The `chr()` function takes an integer as an argument and returns its corresponding ASCII character. For example, `chr(65)` returns 'A'.

2. Using the `str()` Function: The `str()` function can be used to convert an integer to a character. For example, `str(5)` returns '5'.
