[TOC]

# Section 1: Import Necessary Modules 

In order to copy a directory of files into an existing directory, we need to use the `shutil` and `os` modules. 

```python
import shutil
import os
```

# Section 2: Define Source and Destination Directories

We need to define the source and destination directories. The source directory is the directory containing the files you want to copy, and the destination directory is the directory into which you want to copy the files. 

```python
src_dir = "/path/to/source/directory"
dst_dir = "/path/to/destination/directory"
```

# Section 3: Copy Files

We can use the `shutil.copytree()` function to copy the files from the source directory to the destination directory.

```python
shutil.copytree(src_dir, dst_dir)
```

# Section 4: Verify Files Copied

To verify that the files have been copied, we can use the `os.listdir()` function to list the files in the destination directory. 

```python
files_in_dst_dir = os.listdir(dst_dir)
```
