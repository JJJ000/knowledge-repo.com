#### Syntax
The syntax for the `.replace()` method is as follows:

```
string.replace(old, new[, count])
```

#### Parameters
The parameters for the `.replace()` method are as follows:

- `old`: This is a required parameter and is the substring to be replaced. It can be a string or a regular expression.

- `new`: This is a required parameter and is the string to replace `old` with. It can be a string or a function.

- `count`: This is an optional parameter and is the number of times to replace `old` with `new`. If this parameter is not specified, all occurrences of `old` will be replaced.

#### Using Regex
The `.replace()` method can be used with regular expressions by passing a regex object as the `old` parameter. This allows for more complex replacements, such as replacing all occurrences of a certain pattern.

#### Examples
Here are some examples of using the `.replace()` method with regex:

```
# Replace all occurrences of "foo" with "bar"
string.replace(/foo/g, "bar")

# Replace all occurrences of a digit with an asterisk
string.replace(/\d/g, "*")

# Replace the first occurrence of "foo" with "bar"
string.replace(/foo/, "bar", 1)
```
