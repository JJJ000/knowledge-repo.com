tldr: The @property decorator allows a method to be accessed like an attribute, and can be used to define getters, setters, and deleters for class attributes.

### Definition

The @property decorator in Python is a built-in function that allows a programmer to define a method as a property of a class. This allows the method to be accessed like an attribute and eliminates the need to define explicit getter and setter methods.

### Usage

To use the @property decorator, the programmer must first create a method and then add the @property decorator to the beginning of the method. This will make the method into a property of the class. The programmer can then access the property like an attribute and can use the “get” and “set” functions to access and modify the value of the property.

### Benefits

Using the @property decorator has several benefits. It allows the programmer to easily access and modify the value of a property without having to explicitly define getter and setter methods. It also allows the programmer to easily add extra functionality to the property, such as validation or conversion.

### Drawbacks

The main drawback of using the @property decorator is that it can lead to code that is difficult to read and debug. Since the @property decorator adds the property to the class as a method, it can be difficult to tell which methods are properties and which are not. This can lead to confusion and can make debugging more difficult.
