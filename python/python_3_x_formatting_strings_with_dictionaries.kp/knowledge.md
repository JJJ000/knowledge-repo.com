tldr: You can use the format() method with placeholders and pass a dictionary as an argument with keys matching the placeholders.

Section 1: Introduction
Python is a versatile and powerful programming language. It provides many built-in functions and libraries that make programming tasks simpler and more efficient. One such function is string formatting, which allows us to manipulate strings by substituting placeholder values with actual data. Python's string formatting capability can make code more readable and easier to maintain. In this tutorial, we will discuss how to format a string using a dictionary in Python 3.x.

Section 2: Basic String Formatting with Dictionary
To format a string using a dictionary in Python 3.x, we need to use the format() method. The format() method takes one or more positional arguments and returns a string with the placeholders replaced by the arguments. We can also pass a dictionary as the argument to the format() method. Here is an example:

```
person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}
message = 'My name is {name} and I am {age} years old'.format(**person)
print(message)
```

Output:
```
My name is John and I am 25 years old
```

In the above example, we created a dictionary called person with two key-value pairs 'name' and 'age'. Then we created a string message with placeholders {name} and {age}. Finally, we passed the dictionary person as an argument to the format() method using the ** operator (double asterisk) to unpack the dictionary. The format() method replaced the placeholders with the values from the dictionary and returned the formatted string.

Section 3: Advanced String Formatting with Dictionary
We can also use indexing and formatting options with placeholders when formatting a string using a dictionary in Python 3.x. Here is an example:

```
person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25}
message = 'My name is {0[name]} and I am {0[age]:d} years old'.format(person)
print(message)
```

Output:
```
My name is John and I am 25 years old
```

In the above example, we used indexing and formatting options with placeholders. The {0[name]} placeholder refers to the 'name' key of the dictionary at index 0 (which is the same as person). The {0[age]:d} placeholder refers to the 'age' key of the dictionary at index 0 and specifies that the value should be formatted as a decimal integer.

Section 4: Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned how to format a string using a dictionary in Python 3.x. We used the format() method to substitute placeholder values with data from a dictionary. We also learned how to use indexing and formatting options with placeholders. String formatting is a very powerful feature of Python and can make code much easier to read and maintain.
