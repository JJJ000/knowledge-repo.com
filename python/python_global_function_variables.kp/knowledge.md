[TOC]

# Section 1: What are Global Variables?

Global variables are variables that are declared outside of a function and can be accessed from within any function. They are also accessible from outside the function.

# Section 2: How do Global Variables Work in Python?

In Python, global variables are declared using the keyword `global`. When a variable is declared as `global`, it is accessible from within any function, regardless of whether it is declared inside or outside the function.

# Section 3: Advantages and Disadvantages of Global Variables

The main advantage of using global variables is that they allow for the sharing of data between functions. This reduces the amount of code that needs to be written, as the data can be accessed from any function.

However, global variables can also be a source of bugs, as they can be changed from any function. This can lead to unexpected results and can be difficult to debug.

# Section 4: When to Use Global Variables

Global variables should be used sparingly, as they can lead to unexpected results. They should only be used when it is absolutely necessary, such as when data needs to be shared between functions.
