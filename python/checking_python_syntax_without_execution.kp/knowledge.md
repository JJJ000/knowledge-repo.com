### Compile Python Script

The most straightforward way to check the syntax of a Python script without executing it is to compile it. Python scripts are compiled into bytecode, which is then translated into machine language and executed. To compile a script, the `py_compile` module can be used. This module takes a file name as an argument and compiles it into bytecode.

### Use a Linter

Another way to check the syntax of a Python script without executing it is to use a linter. A linter is a tool that checks code for potential errors, such as syntax errors. Popular Python linters include Pylint and Flake8. These linters can be used to check for errors in a Python script before it is executed.

### Use an IDE

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are a great way to check the syntax of a Python script without executing it. IDEs typically come with a built-in linter that can be used to check for syntax errors. Popular Python IDEs include PyCharm and Visual Studio Code.

### Use Online Tools

There are also online tools that can be used to check the syntax of a Python script without executing it. These tools typically use a linter to check for syntax errors. Popular online Python syntax checkers include PythonTutor and Repl.it.
