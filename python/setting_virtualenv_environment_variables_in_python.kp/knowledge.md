## Introduction

Virtualenv is an essential tool for Python developers to create and manage isolated environments for different projects. When working on a project, we may need to set up environment variables to store sensitive information, configuration values, or other data. In this article, we will discuss how to set an environment variable in virtualenv in Python.

## Creating a virtual environment

Before we can start setting environment variables, we need to create a virtual environment using virtualenv. Here's the command to create a virtual environment in Python:

```
$ virtualenv env
```

Here, 'env' is the name of the virtual environment.

Once we run this command, a new directory named 'env' will be created in the current directory. This directory will contain all the necessary files and directories to set up the virtual environment.

## Setting an environment variable

To set an environment variable in virtualenv, we need to activate the virtual environment first. We can do this by running the following command:

```
$ source env/bin/activate
```

Here, 'env' is the name of the virtual environment.

Once the virtual environment is active, we can set the environment variable using the following command:

```
$ export VAR_NAME=value
```

Here, 'VAR_NAME' is the name of the variable, and 'value' is the value to be assigned to the variable.

## Using the environment variable

Once we have set the environment variable, we can use it in our Python program using the 'os' module. Here's an example of how to use the environment variable in Python:

```python
import os

var_value = os.environ.get('VAR_NAME')
print(var_value)
```

This code will fetch the value of the environment variable named 'VAR_NAME' and store it in the 'var_value' variable. We can then use this variable in our program as required.

## Conclusion

Virtualenv provides a convenient way to create and manage isolated environments for different Python projects. Setting environment variables in virtualenv is a simple process that can be done using the 'export' command. Once set, we can use the environment variable in our Python program using the 'os' module.
