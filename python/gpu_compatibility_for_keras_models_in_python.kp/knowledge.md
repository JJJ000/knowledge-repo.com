Prerequisites

To run Keras models on GPUs in Python, make sure to have the following prerequisites:

- a TensorFlow installation with GPU support
- CUDA and cuDNN libraries installed on your system
- a compatible GPU device


Section 1: Configure the TensorFlow GPU environment

The first step is to configure the TensorFlow GPU environment to enable the use of the GPU. This can be done by running the following Python code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
physical_devices = tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')
tf.config.experimental.set_memory_growth(physical_devices[0], True)
```

This code lists all the available physical GPU devices and sets the memory growth option to allow the TensorFlow runtime to allocate memory on the GPU as needed. If you have multiple GPUs, select the one you want to use or implement load balancing.


Section 2: Define and compile the Keras model

Next, define and compile your Keras model as usual:

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_dim=100))
model.add(Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))

model.compile(loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              optimizer='sgd',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

This example defines a simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer, relu activation function, and softmax output layer. The loss function is categorical cross-entropy, and the optimizer is stochastic gradient descent. Feel free to modify the architecture and the parameters as you prefer.


Section 3: Train the Keras model on GPU

You can now train your Keras model on GPU using the `fit()` method. Just pass your training data and the desired number of epochs:

```python
import numpy as np

x_train = np.random.random((1000, 100))
y_train = np.random.randint(10, size=(1000, 1))

model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
```

This code generates random synthetic data and trains the model for ten epochs with a batch size of 32. The GPU acceleration should speed up the training significantly compared to running on the CPU.


Section 4: Evaluate and predict with the Keras model on GPU

Finally, you can evaluate and predict with your Keras model on GPU as well:

```python
x_test = np.random.random((100, 100))
y_test = np.random.randint(10, size=(100, 1))

loss, acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f'Test loss: {loss:.4f}')
print(f'Test accuracy: {acc:.4f}')

y_pred = model.predict(x_test)
print(f'Predictions: {y_pred}')
```

This code generates random test data and evaluates the model's loss and accuracy metrics. It then uses the model to predict on the test data and prints the results. Again, the GPU should speed up these operations compared to running on the CPU.
