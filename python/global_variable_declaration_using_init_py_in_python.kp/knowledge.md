tldr: Yes, it is possible to use `\_\_init\_\_.py` to define global variables in Python, but it is not recommended because it can lead to confusion and unexpected behavior.

**Contents**

[TOC]

No, it is not recommended to define global variables in the `__init__.py` file in Python. Here's why:

### 1. The __init__.py file is not a module

The `__init__.py` file is a file that Python uses to mark a directory as a Python package. It is not a module itself, and therefore should not be used to define variables or functions that will be used across multiple modules or packages.

### 2. Global variables can lead to unintended consequences

Using global variables can lead to unintended consequences in your code. If a global variable is modified in one part of your code, it can affect the behavior of other parts of your code that also depend on that variable. This can make it difficult to debug and maintain your code.

### 3. Better alternatives are available

In Python, there are better alternatives to using global variables. For example, you can use function arguments and return values to pass data between functions, or you can use class-level variables to store data that is shared across multiple instances of a class.

### 4. It goes against Python coding conventions

Lastly, defining global variables in the `__init__.py` file goes against Python coding conventions. Python follows the "batteries included" philosophy, which means that the Python standard library provides a set of modules that cover most basic programming needs. By using these modules and following standard coding conventions, you can write more readable, maintainable, and Pythonic code.
