**Contents**

[TOC]

# Section 1: Using read()
The read() method can be used to read a file line by line and store it as a string. This method takes an optional parameter, size, which is the number of characters to read. If size is not specified, the entire contents of the file will be read and stored as a single string.

# Section 2: Using readlines()
The readlines() method can be used to read a file and store each line as an element in a list. This method takes an optional parameter, sizehint, which is the approximate number of bytes to read from the file. If sizehint is not specified, the entire contents of the file will be read and stored as a list of strings.

# Section 3: Stripping Newlines
Once the contents of the file have been read into a string or list, the newline characters can be removed using the strip() method. This method takes no parameters and will remove all trailing whitespace, including newline characters.

# Section 4: Example Code
Below is an example of how to read a file without newlines in Python:

```python
# Open the file
f = open("file.txt", "r")

# Read the file
data = f.read()

# Strip the newlines
data = data.strip()

# Close the file
f.close()
```
