# Introduction

The `requests` library in Python allows users to make HTTP requests to web servers. This library provides a convenient way to make requests and receive responses from a server. It also provides a way to set options such as `max_retries` to control the number of retries that are attempted when a request fails.

# Setting max_retries

The `max_retries` option can be set when making a request with the `requests` library. This option allows users to specify the maximum number of retries that will be attempted if a request fails. To set this option, users should pass a `max_retries` keyword argument to the `requests.request` function. This argument should be set to the desired number of retries.

# Example

Here is an example of how to set the `max_retries` option when making a request with the `requests` library:

```python
import requests

response = requests.request(
    method='GET',
    url='https://example.com',
    max_retries=3
)
```

In this example, the `max_retries` option is set to `3`, which means that the request will be retried up to three times if it fails.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the `max_retries` option can be set when making a request with the `requests` library in Python. This option allows users to control the number of retries that are attempted when a request fails.
