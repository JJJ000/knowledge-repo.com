# Solution

## Installing TensorFlow
TensorFlow can be installed using pip, a package manager for Python. To install TensorFlow using pip, open a command prompt window and type:

`pip install tensorflow`

This will install the latest version of TensorFlow for Python.

## Troubleshooting
If TensorFlow is not found using pip, it may be because the version of Python you are using is not supported by TensorFlow. To check the version of Python you are using, type `python --version` in the command prompt.

If the version of Python is not supported, you can download an older version of TensorFlow from the TensorFlow website.

## Alternatives
If you don't want to install TensorFlow using pip, there are other ways to install it. You can use Anaconda, a Python distribution that includes TensorFlow, or build TensorFlow from source.
