tldr: Use a Dictionary when you need key-value pairs, a List when you need an ordered sequence of items, and a Set when you need an unordered collection of unique items.

## Dictionary
A dictionary is a data structure used to map keys to values. It is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are useful when you need to store and retrieve values based on a key. For example, a dictionary could be used to store a list of employee names and their corresponding employee ID numbers.

## List
A list is an ordered collection of objects. Lists are useful for storing and manipulating data that needs to be in a specific order. For example, a list could be used to store a grocery list with items in the order that they need to be purchased.

## Set
A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are useful for storing and manipulating data that needs to be unique. For example, a set could be used to store a list of unique words in a document.
