**Contents**

[TOC]

Section 1: Introduction

Jinja is a powerful templating language that is widely used in web development with Python. Jinja has many built-in filters and functions to manipulate data in a template. One such filter is the `string` filter, which can be used to convert an integer to a string in Jinja.

Section 2: Using the string filter in Jinja

To convert an integer to a string in Jinja, you can use the `string` filter. Here is an example:

```python
{% set my_int = 42 %}
{{ my_int|string }}
```

This code first sets a variable `my_int` to an integer value of `42`. Then, the `string` filter is used to convert `my_int` to a string, which is then displayed using the double curly brace syntax (`{{ }}`).

The output of this code would be:

```
42
```

As you can see, the `string` filter has converted the integer value of `42` to a string value.

Section 3: Using the string function in Jinja

Another way to convert an integer to a string in Jinja is to use the `string` function. Here is an example:

```python
{% set my_int = 42 %}
{{ my_int|string() }}
```

This code is similar to the previous example, but instead of using the `string` filter, we are using the `string` function. The `string` function takes no arguments, so the empty parentheses `()` are used to call it.

The output of this code would be the same as the previous example:

```
42
```

Section 4: Conclusion

In this tutorial, we learned how to convert an integer to a string in Jinja using both the `string` filter and the `string` function. These methods are useful for manipulating data in templates and can be used to create dynamic content.
