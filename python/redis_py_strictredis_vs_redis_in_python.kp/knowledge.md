tldr: StrictRedis() enforces Redis 2.8+ commands while Redis() allows for backward compatibility with older Redis versions.

## Introduction

Redis-py is a Python library for interacting with Redis, an in-memory data structure store often used as a database, cache, and message broker. This library provides two main classes for interacting with Redis: StrictRedis and Redis. This article discusses the differences between these two classes.

## StrictRedis

The StrictRedis class implements Redis commands using a strict, pedantic mode. This means that it raises exceptions for certain errors, such as when trying to perform an operation on a key that doesn't exist. Here are some key features of StrictRedis:

- Raises exceptions for errors: The StrictRedis class raises exceptions for certain errors, such as when trying to perform an operation on a key that doesn't exist.
- No shortcut methods: There are no shortcut methods available in the StrictRedis class. For example, there is no `incr()` method; instead, you must use the `incrby()` method with a value of 1.
- More accurate error messages: Because StrictRedis raises exceptions for certain errors, the error messages are often more accurate than those generated by the Redis class.

## Redis

The Redis class implements Redis commands using a more relaxed mode. This means that it does not always raise exceptions for certain errors, such as when trying to perform an operation on a key that doesn't exist. Here are some key features of Redis:

- Does not always raise exceptions: The Redis class does not always raise exceptions for certain errors, such as when trying to perform an operation on a key that doesn't exist.
- Shortcut methods available: The Redis class has shortcut methods available for many commands. For example, instead of using the `incrby()` method with a value of 1, you can use the `incr()` method.
- May produce inaccurate error messages: Because Redis does not always raise exceptions for certain errors, the error messages may not always be accurate.

## Conclusion

The choice between using StrictRedis or Redis depends on your use case. If you need strict error handling and more accurate error messages, then use StrictRedis. If you prefer shortcut methods and don't need strict error handling, then use Redis. Ultimately, both classes provide a way to interact with Redis from Python, and you should choose the one that best fits your needs.
