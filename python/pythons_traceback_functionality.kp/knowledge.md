1. Introduction
In Java, the e.printStackTrace() method is used to print detailed information about an error that occurred during runtime. It displays the error's stack trace, along with the line number and class where the error occurred. Python also provides an equivalent method for printing error messages and stack traces.

2. traceback Module
Python's traceback module provides various functions for formatting and printing stack traces. The traceback.print_exc() function can be used to print the most recent exception traceback to the standard error stream (stderr). It prints the stack trace along with the error message. Here is an example:

import traceback

try:
    # some code that may raise an error
except Exception as e:
    traceback.print_exc()

This will print the error message and the stack trace to the console.

3. logging Module
Python's logging module provides a more advanced way of handling errors and printing stack traces. It allows you to log errors to a file or a database and control the level of detail included in the error message. Here is an example:

import logging

try:
    # some code that may raise an error
except Exception as e:
    logging.exception(e)

This will log the error message and the stack trace to a file or the console, depending on your configuration.

4. sys.exc_info()
The sys.exc_info() function can also be used in Python to get information about the most recent exception. It returns a tuple containing the exception type, value, and traceback. You can then use the traceback.format_tb() function to format the traceback and print it to the console. Here is an example:

import sys
import traceback

try:
    # some code that may raise an error
except Exception as e:
    exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback = sys.exc_info()
    traceback.print_tb(exc_traceback)

This will print the stack trace to the console, without the error message.
