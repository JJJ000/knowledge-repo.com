Introduction
One of the common scenarios in programming is using conditional statements, typically the if-else statement, to dictate the flow of code execution. In Python, it is possible to write code that uses either if-return-return or if-else-return, but which one should you use? This article presents a comparison of the two approaches to determine which one is more efficient.

Explanation of if-return-return and if-else-return
If-return-return is a type of conditional statement in Python that uses two return statements inside an if statement. The if statement checks if the condition is true and if it is, executes the first return statement, which breaks out of the function. If the condition is false, the second return statement is executed, which ends the function.

On the other hand, if-else-return is a type of conditional statement in Python that uses an if-else block and a single return statement. The if-else block checks if the condition is true, and if it is, the return statement inside the if block is executed. If the condition is false, the return statement inside the else block is executed.

Efficiency Comparison
To determine which approach is more efficient, we need to consider a few factors, including readability, maintainability, and performance.

Regarding readability, both approaches are clear and easy to understand. However, if-else-return might be slightly more readable since it is a common pattern in Python.

When it comes to maintainability, if-else-return is a better choice since it is easier to modify and extend. Changing the if condition in if-return-return requires editing two return statements, which could introduce errors.

Finally, in terms of performance, if-else-return is more efficient since the condition is only evaluated once. In if-return-return, the condition is evaluated twice, which could hurt performance in complex conditions.

Conclusion
In conclusion, if-else-return is a better choice for conditional statements in Python since it is more maintainable and performant. If-return-return might be useful in some scenarios, but if-else-return is a more established pattern and one that will likely be easier to understand for most Python developers.
