#Comprehension

Comprehension is a syntactic construct in Python that allows for easy creation of lists, dictionaries, and sets. It provides a concise way to create lists without having to write for loops. Comprehension is a powerful tool for quickly creating data structures.

#Lambda + Filter

Lambda is a Python keyword used to create anonymous functions. It allows for the creation of functions without the need to define a name. The filter() function takes a function and an iterable as arguments, and returns an iterator with the elements from the iterable for which the function returns True. This can be used to filter out elements from a list, dictionary, or set.

#Differences

Comprehension is a construct that enables the creation of data structures in a concise way. It is used to create lists, dictionaries, and sets. Lambda and filter are used to filter elements from an iterable. Lambda is used to create anonymous functions, and filter is used to apply the function to the iterable. Comprehension is more concise and easier to read, while lambda and filter are more flexible and can be used to create more complex filters.
