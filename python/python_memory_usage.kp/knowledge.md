## Total Memory Used

The total memory used by a Python process depends on a variety of factors, including the size of the program, the libraries used, and the operating system.

## Memory Usage in Python

Python programs typically use a small amount of memory compared to other programming languages. This is due to the dynamic nature of Python and its garbage collection system. A typical Python program will use only a few megabytes of memory, while a large program may use up to several gigabytes.

## Memory Allocation

When a Python program is running, the operating system allocates memory to the process. This memory is divided into two parts: the stack and the heap. The stack is used for storing local variables and function calls, while the heap is used for dynamic memory allocation.

## Memory Management

Python's garbage collection system helps to manage memory usage by automatically reclaiming memory that is no longer needed. The garbage collector runs periodically and checks for objects that are no longer referenced by the program. These objects are then removed and the memory is freed up for use by the program.
