### Logical AND Operator
Python's equivalent of the logical AND operator is the `and` operator. This operator returns `True` if both the operands (right and left of the `and` operator) are `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

### Syntax
The syntax for the `and` operator is:
```
expression1 and expression2
```

### Example
The following example illustrates the use of the `and` operator in an if-statement:
```
if (x == 3 and y == 5):
    print("x is 3 and y is 5")
```

### Usage
The `and` operator can be used in an if-statement to check if multiple conditions are `True` before executing the code inside the if-statement's block.
