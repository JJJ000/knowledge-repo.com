[TOC]

Yes, Python has a package/module management system. 

## Overview 
Python's package/module management system is based on the concept of a package, which is a collection of modules. A package is simply a directory that contains a special file called `__init__.py` and other Python files. Packages can have sub-packages, which are also directories with their own `__init__.py` file, and modules, which are standalone Python files.

## Package/Module Management Tools
Python provides several tools for managing packages and modules, including:
- **pip:** A package installer for Python that allows users to install, uninstall, and manage Python packages easily. Pip comes installed by default with Python 3.4 and higher.
- **virtualenv:** A tool that creates isolated Python environments, allowing users to install packages without interfering with the global Python installation.
- **conda:** A package management system that is used to install, build and manage software packages written in Python and works on Linux, OS X and Windows.

## Package/Module Management Workflow
To use Python's package/module management system, one typically follows these general steps:
1. Identify the needed package/module
2. Use `pip` or `conda` to install the package/module
3. Import the package/module in the Python code

## Conclusion
Python's package/module management system provides a convenient way to organize and distribute Python code. With the help of tools like `pip`, `virtualenv`, and `conda`, it's easy to manage and install packages and modules as needed. This helps Python programmers to be more productive and efficient in their development work.
