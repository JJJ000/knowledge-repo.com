tldr: One way to support equivalence in Python classes is to define the \_\_eq\_\_() method, which compares two objects and returns True if they are equal.

1. __Inheritance:__ Inheritance is a powerful feature of object-oriented programming that allows classes to inherit attributes and methods from their parent class. This allows classes to share behavior and data, which can help to support equality by providing a common set of features and capabilities.

2. __Encapsulation:__ Encapsulation is a way of protecting the data within an object from outside interference. By providing a layer of protection from external access, encapsulation ensures that objects of different classes can be treated the same way. This helps to support equality by providing a consistent way of interacting with different classes.

3. __Polymorphism:__ Polymorphism is a technique that allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in different ways. This helps to support equality by allowing different classes to be treated the same way, regardless of their implementation.

4. __Abstraction:__ Abstraction is a technique that allows objects of different classes to be treated in the same way, regardless of their internal implementation. This helps to support equality by providing a way of interacting with objects without having to worry about their internal structure.
