# Section 1: Importing Libraries

The first step to parsing JSON in Python is to import the necessary libraries. The most popular library for parsing JSON is the `json` library, which is part of the standard library. To use this library, you must import it like so:

```python
import json
```

# Section 2: Reading JSON

Once you have imported the `json` library, you can use the `json.load()` or `json.loads()` functions to read a JSON string or file.

`json.load()` takes a file object and returns a Python object (a dictionary or list, depending on the structure of the JSON).

`json.loads()` takes a string and returns a Python object (a dictionary or list, depending on the structure of the JSON).

# Section 3: Accessing Data

Once you have loaded the JSON data, you can access the data by using the keys in the dictionary or the indices in the list.

For example, if you have a dictionary of data, you can access the values by using the keys like so:

```python
data = json.load(file)
value1 = data['key1']
value2 = data['key2']
```

# Section 4: Writing JSON

You can also use the `json.dump()` or `json.dumps()` functions to write JSON data.

`json.dump()` takes a Python object and writes it to a file.

`json.dumps()` takes a Python object and returns a JSON string.
