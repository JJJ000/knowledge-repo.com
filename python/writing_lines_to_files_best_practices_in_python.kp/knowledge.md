tldr: The correct way to write a line to a file in Python is to use the file object`s write() method.

[TOC]

**Section 1: Opening a File**

The first step in writing to a file is opening the file. This can be done using the `open()` function.

```python
f = open('file_name.txt', 'w')
```

The `open()` function takes two arguments: the file name and the mode. The mode argument specifies the mode in which the file is opened. In this case, we are opening the file in write mode, so the mode is set to `'w'`.

**Section 2: Writing to File**

Once the file is opened, we can write to it using the `write()` function.

```python
f.write('This is a line of text.')
```

The `write()` function takes a string as an argument and writes it to the file.

**Section 3: Closing the File**

Once we are done writing to the file, it is important to close the file. This can be done using the `close()` function.

```python
f.close()
```

**Section 4: Error Handling**

It is important to handle any errors that may occur when writing to a file. This can be done using a `try`/`except` block.

```python
try:
    f = open('file_name.txt', 'w')
    f.write('This is a line of text.')
except IOError:
    print('An error occurred while writing to the file.')
finally:
    f.close()
```

In this example, we open the file in write mode and write a line of text to the file. If an error occurs, the `except` block will be executed and an error message will be printed. Finally, the `finally` block will be executed regardless of whether an error occurs or not, and the file will be closed.
