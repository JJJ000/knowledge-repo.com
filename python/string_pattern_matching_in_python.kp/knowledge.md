**Section 1: Overview**

This answer provides an overview of how to check if a string matches a pattern in Python. It explains how to use the re module to apply regular expressions to strings to check for a match and provides an example of how to use the module.

**Section 2: Using the re Module**

The re module in Python can be used to apply regular expressions to strings and check for a match. Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, which can be used to match or replace patterns in strings.

**Section 3: Example**

For example, to check if a string matches a pattern, you can use the re.search() method. This method takes two arguments: a regular expression pattern and the string to be searched. The method will return a match object if the pattern is found in the string.

**Section 4: Conclusion**

In conclusion, the re module in Python can be used to check if a string matches a given pattern. The re.search() method takes a regular expression pattern and the string to be searched, and returns a match object if the pattern is found.
