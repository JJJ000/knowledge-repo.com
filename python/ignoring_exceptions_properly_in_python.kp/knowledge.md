# 1. Try-Except Block
The try-except block is a standard method for handling exceptions in Python. This method is used to catch exceptions that may occur in a program and handle them appropriately. The syntax for this is as follows:

```
try:
    # code that may throw an exception
except Exception as e:
    # code to handle the exception
```

# 2. Context Managers
Context managers are another way to handle exceptions in Python. This method is used to set up a context within which exceptions can be handled. The syntax for this is as follows:

```
with context_manager as target:
    # code that may throw an exception
    # code to handle the exception
```

# 3. Logging
Logging is an important part of exception handling in Python. This method is used to record the details of any exceptions that occur in a program. This can be used to debug the program and identify any issues that may have caused the exception. The syntax for this is as follows:

```
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logging.exception("Exception occurred")
```

# 4. Custom Exception Handling
Custom exception handling is a more advanced method for handling exceptions in Python. This method is used to create custom exception classes that can be used to handle specific exceptions. The syntax for this is as follows:

```
class CustomException(Exception):
    def __init__(self, message):
        self.message = message

try:
    # code that may throw an exception
except CustomException as e:
    # code to handle the exception
```
