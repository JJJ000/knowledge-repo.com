### Introduction
A pickle file is a file format used in Python that allows objects to be serialized (converted into a format that can be stored and sent over the internet or over a network to another instance of Python) and later deserialized (the process of reconstructing the original object from the serialized representation). In this guide, we will learn how to read a pickle file in Python.

### Step 1: Import the `pickle` module
To read a pickle file in Python, we must first import the `pickle` module. The `pickle` module provides functions for serializing and deserializing Python objects. 

```python
import pickle
```

### Step 2: Open the pickle file
Once we have imported the `pickle` module, we can open the pickle file using the `open()` function in the same way we would open any file in Python. Make sure that the file you want to read exists in the current working directory. 

```python
with open('filename.pickle', 'rb') as f:
    data = pickle.load(f)
```

Here, `filename.pickle` is the name of the pickle file that we want to read, and `rb` specifies that we want to open the file in read binary mode. The `with` statement ensures that the file is properly closed once we are done reading it.

### Step 3: Read the contents of the pickle file
We can now read the contents of the pickle file. In this example, we assume that the file contains a dictionary. 

```python
print(data)
```

This will print the contents of the `data` variable, which should be a dictionary.

### Step 4: Put it all together
To read a pickle file, we can put all the steps together in the following code:

```python
import pickle

with open('filename.pickle', 'rb') as f:
    data = pickle.load(f)
    
print(data)
```

This code will open the pickle file `filename.pickle`, load its contents into a variable called `data`, and print the contents of the variable to the console.
