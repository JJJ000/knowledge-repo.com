# Using the read() method

- The simplest way to read only the first line of a file in Python is to use the `read()` method on the file object.
- The `read()` method reads the entire content of the file and returns it as a string.
- By specifying the number of characters to read (in this case, the length of the first line), we can get only the first line of the file.

Example:

```python
with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:
    first_line = file.read(len(file.readline()))
    print(first_line)
```


# Using the readline() method

- Another way to read only the first line of a file in Python is to use the `readline()` method.
- The `readline()` method reads and returns the first line of the file as a string.
- This method is useful when you only need to read a specific line, such as the first line.

Example:

```python
with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:
    first_line = file.readline()
    print(first_line)
```


# Using the next() function

- Another way to read only the first line of a file in Python is to use the built-in `next()` function.
- The `next()` function returns the next line in the file.
- By calling `next()` once, we get the first line of the file.

Example:

```python
with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:
    first_line = next(file)
    print(first_line)
```
