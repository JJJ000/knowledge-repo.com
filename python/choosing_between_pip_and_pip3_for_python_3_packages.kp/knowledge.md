tldr: It depends on the system configuration; for some, pip is used for Python 3, while in others, pip3 is used instead.

Introduction

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and it offers a wide range of tools and libraries to developers. However, installing new packages can be confusing, especially for those who are new to the language.

One of the most common questions that developers ask is whether they should use pip or pip3 to install packages for Python 3. In this guide, we will explore the differences between the two and explain when you should use each of them.

What is pip?

Pip is the package installer for Python. It allows developers to install third-party libraries and packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) using a simple command-line interface. Pip is included with Python 2.7.9 and later versions and Python 3.4 and later versions.

What is pip3?

Pip3 is a newer version of pip and is designed specifically for Python 3.x. It is a separate tool from pip and is used to install packages for Python 3.x. Pip3 is included with Python 3.x distributions and is not available for Python 2.x.

When should you use pip?

If you are working with Python 2.x, then you should use pip. Pip is included with Python 2.7.9 and later versions, and it is the default package installer for Python 2.x.

However, if you are working with Python 3.x and the package you want to install is compatible with both Python 2.x and Python 3.x, then you can use pip. In this case, you should use the pip3 command to install packages for Python 3.x.

When should you use pip3?

If you are working with Python 3.x, then you should use pip3 to install packages. Pip3 is the default package installer for Python 3.x and is designed specifically for this version of the language. This means that it is more reliable and efficient than pip when it comes to installing packages for Python 3.x.

Conclusion

In general, you should use pip to install packages for Python 2.x and pip3 to install packages for Python 3.x. However, if a package is compatible with both versions of the language, you can use either pip or pip3 to install it.
