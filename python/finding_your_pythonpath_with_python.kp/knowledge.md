# Section 1: Overview

Python Path (PYTHONPATH) is an environment variable which is used to tell the Python interpreter where to look for modules when importing packages. It is a list of directories where the interpreter looks for modules when importing them.

# Section 2: Accessing PYTHONPATH

The PYTHONPATH can be accessed by using the `os` module. The `os.environ` method will return a dictionary of all the environment variables and their values. The PYTHONPATH can be accessed by using the key `PYTHONPATH`:

```python
import os

python_path = os.environ['PYTHONPATH']
```

# Section 3: Modifying PYTHONPATH

The PYTHONPATH can be modified by using the `os.environ` method. The `os.environ` method takes a key and a value as arguments and updates the environment variable with the given value. To add a directory to the PYTHONPATH, you can use the `os.path.join` method to join the existing PYTHONPATH and the new directory:

```python
import os

new_dir = '/my/new/directory'

os.environ['PYTHONPATH'] = os.path.join(os.environ['PYTHONPATH'], new_dir)
```

# Section 4: Conclusion

The PYTHONPATH can be accessed and modified using the `os` module. It is a list of directories where the Python interpreter looks for modules when importing them. The `os.environ` method can be used to access the PYTHONPATH, and the `os.environ` and `os.path.join` methods can be used to modify the PYTHONPATH.
