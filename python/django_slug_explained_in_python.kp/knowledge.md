[TOC]

#### Definition
A slug in Django is a short label containing only letters, numbers, underscores, or hyphens. It is used to identify a particular record in the database and is typically used in URLs.

#### Usage
Slugs are used in URLs to make them more user-friendly and easier to remember. For example, a URL to a blog post may include the slug “how-to-make-pancakes” instead of a long string of numbers and letters.

#### Benefits
Slugs are useful for SEO purposes as they make URLs more descriptive and easier to read. They also help to make URLs more unique, which can be beneficial for tracking purposes.

#### Limitations
Slugs are limited in length and cannot contain spaces or special characters. This can make it difficult to create slugs that are descriptive and easy to remember. Additionally, slugs must be unique, so it can be difficult to create a slug that has not already been used.
