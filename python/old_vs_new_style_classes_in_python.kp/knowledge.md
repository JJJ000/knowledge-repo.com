tldr: Old style classes are based on the classic class model, while new style classes are based on the new class model introduced in Python 2.2.

[TOC]

### Definition
Old style classes are classes that are written in Python versions prior to 2.2 and are identified by the class keyword. New style classes are classes that are written in Python version 2.2 or higher and are identified by the object keyword.

### Syntax
Old style classes do not require the object keyword, while new style classes must include the object keyword.

### Features
Old style classes do not support inheritance from multiple classes, while new style classes do. Additionally, old style classes do not support properties, descriptors, or slots, while new style classes do.

### Usage
Old style classes are no longer supported in Python 3, and all classes should be written in the new style format.
