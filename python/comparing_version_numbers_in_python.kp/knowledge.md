# Using the Loose Version Comparison Operators

Python provides a set of loose comparison operators that can be used to compare version numbers. These operators are <, <=, >, and >=. They will compare the version numbers as strings, so they will not take into account any sort of numerical ordering.

# Using the Strict Version Comparison Operators

Python also provides a set of strict comparison operators that can be used to compare version numbers. These operators are ==, !=, <>, and ~=. They will compare the version numbers as integers, so they will take into account numerical ordering.

# Using the Version Module

The version module in Python provides a method for comparing version numbers. The method, called compare_version(), takes two strings as parameters and returns an integer that indicates the result of the comparison. A return value of 0 indicates that the two version numbers are equal, while a value of 1 indicates that the first version number is greater than the second, and a value of -1 indicates that the first version number is less than the second.

# Using Regular Expressions

Regular expressions can also be used to compare version numbers in Python. The regex pattern should be set up to match the version numbers, and then the match() method can be used to compare them. If the match is successful, the version numbers are equal; if not, they are not equal.
