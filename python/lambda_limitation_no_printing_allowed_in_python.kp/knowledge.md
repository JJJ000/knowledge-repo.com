tldr: Lambda is an expression that returns a value rather than a statement, and hence it cannot print directly.

Section 1: Introduction
Lambda is an anonymous function in Python that allows the definition of small functions without the need for a name. It is often used in Python to provide a short one-line function definition. While Lambda functions are a powerful feature of Python, there are some peculiarities that developers should take note of. One major limitation of Lambda is the inability to use the print statement. This paper will explain why print does not work in Lambda in Python.

Section 2: Python 3's print Function
Python3 print function is a built-in function that outputs text to the console or the standard output stream. It is used to display information or debugging messages. The print function is used to display output to the console. However, it is not a function that can be used in every situation. 

Section 3: The Python Lambda Function
Lambda functions are anonymous functions that can be defined and used without using a variable name. It is a small function that can accept arguments but does not have any function name. The lambda function is also used to create a function object. It is a powerful tool used for creating functions quickly and easily.

Section 4: Why Lambda Functions Cannot Use Print
The print statement is a function that outputs data to the console. Lambda does not work with print statements (as mentioned earlier), because it is designed to return a value rather than output to the console. Any output in a Lambda function is done by returning a value. When you pass a Lambda function to a method that expects a callable, the value is passed back to the caller method.

Conclusion
This paper has highlighted the limitations of the Lambda function in Python, which, in part, are why print does not work with the Lambda function. Developers should, therefore, refrain from using the print statement in Lambda functions since it is designed to return a value rather than output to the console. Nonetheless, Python's Lambda function is a powerful feature that can help developers create functions quickly and easily.
