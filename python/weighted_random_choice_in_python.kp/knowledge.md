tldr: A weighted version of random.choice in Python is random.choices, which allows for weights to be assigned to each element in the sequence.

# Weighted Choice
Weighted random choice is a method of randomly selecting an item from a list, where each item is associated with a weight. The item with the highest weight has the highest probability of being selected.

# Algorithm
The algorithm for weighted choice is as follows:

1. Calculate the total sum of all weights.
2. Generate a random number in the range of 0 to the total sum.
3. Iterate through the list of items and subtract each itemâ€™s weight from the random number.
4. The item whose weight causes the random number to be less than or equal to zero is the selected item.

# Implementation
The following is a simple implementation of weighted choice in Python:

```
import random

def weighted_choice(items):
    total_weight = sum(w for item, w in items)
    n = random.uniform(0, total_weight)
    for item, w in items:
        if n < w:
            return item
        n = n - w
    return item
```

# Usage
The weighted_choice() function can be used to select a random item from a list of tuples containing items and their associated weights. For example:

```
items = [('apple', 10), ('banana', 5), ('orange', 20)]
selected_item = weighted_choice(items)
```

In this example, the item with the highest weight (orange) has the highest probability of being selected.
