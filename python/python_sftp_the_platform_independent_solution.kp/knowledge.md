Section 1: Introduction to SFTP 
SFTP stands for Secure File Transfer Protocol. It is a secure variant of FTP that allows for file transfer over a secured connection. SFTP uses SSH to establish a secure connection, which means it encrypts all data being transferred between the client and the server. SFTP is often used as a replacement for FTP when security is a concern. 

Section 2: SFTP in Python 
There are multiple libraries out there that allow you to use SFTP in Python. Some of the most popular ones include Paramiko, pysftp, and ssh2-python. These libraries provide a Pythonic way of using SFTP and allow you to perform tasks such as uploading and downloading files or manipulating files on a remote server. 

Section 3: Using pysftp 
One of the easiest ways to use SFTP in Python is with the pysftp library. Pysftp provides an easy-to-use interface for SFTP that is consistent with the FTP module. The following example demonstrates how to use pysftp to connect to an SFTP server, upload a file, and download a file.

```python
import pysftp

# Credentials
cnopts = pysftp.CnOpts()
cnopts.hostkeys = None

# Connect
with pysftp.Connection('sftp.example.com', username='myuser', password='mypassword', cnopts=cnopts) as sftp:
    # Upload
    sftp.put('sourcefile.txt', '/destinationfile.txt')

    # Download
    sftp.get('/remotefile.txt', 'localfile.txt')
```
In this example, we first create a `CnOpts` object which disables host key checking. This is only recommended for development environments and not production. Next, we connect to the SFTP server using the `Connection` object and provide our credentials. Once connected, we use the `put` method to upload a file and the `get` method to download a file.

Section 4: Conclusion 
SFTP is an important protocol for securely transferring files over the internet. Python provides multiple libraries that make it easy to use SFTP in your applications. Whether you are uploading, downloading, or manipulating files on a remote server, the libraries we reviewed can help you accomplish it all in Python.
