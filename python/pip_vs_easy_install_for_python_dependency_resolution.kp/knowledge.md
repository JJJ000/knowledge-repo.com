## Introduction

`pip` and `easy_install` are package managers for Python. Their main function is to manage the installation and upgrading of Python packages. `pip` is the newer and more commonly used package manager while `easy_install` is the older and less preferred package manager. In this article, we will explore the benefits of using `pip` over `easy_install` for `python setup.py install` dependency resolution.


## Benefits of using pip over easy_install

There are several benefits of using `pip` over `easy_install` when it comes to `python setup.py install` dependency resolution. Some of these benefits include:

### Better handling of package dependencies

`pip` is known for its excellent handling of package dependencies. When installing a package with `pip`, it automatically installs any dependencies that are required by the package. Additionally, it checks the dependencies for compatibility issues and installs compatible versions of the dependencies. This ensures that all the required packages are installed and compatible with each other, which is crucial for the smooth running of the application.

`easy_install`, on the other hand, installs packages without checking dependencies. It only installs the package that you have specified and does not ensure that all the required dependencies are installed. This can result in missing or incompatible packages, which can cause issues during runtime.

### Better support for virtual environments

Virtual environments are a crucial tool for Python developers. They allow you to create an isolated working environment for your Python code, which ensures that your code is not affected by the system's default Python installation or other installations on the same machine. Virtual environments are created using tools like `virtualenv` or `venv`.

`pip` has better support for virtual environments than `easy_install`. It automatically detects the virtual environment you are working in and installs the packages into the correct environment. Additionally, `pip` allows you to create a requirements file that contains a list of all the packages required by your application. This makes it easy to reproduce the environment on a different machine or share the environment with other developers.

`easy_install`, on the other hand, can install packages into the wrong virtual environment, especially if there are multiple environments on the same machine. This can cause conflicts and issues during runtime.

### Better error reporting and debugging

`pip` provides better error reporting and debugging than `easy_install`. When installing a package, `pip` displays detailed messages about the installation process, including the progress, the packages being installed, and any errors that occur during the installation. This makes it easy to identify and fix installation issues.

`easy_install`, on the other hand, does not provide detailed error messages, making it difficult to identify the cause of the installation issues.

### Better community support

`pip` is widely used by the Python community and has a large and active user base. This means that there is a lot of community support available, including documentation, tutorials, and online forums. Additionally, `pip` is constantly being improved and updated, which ensures that it remains up-to-date with the latest developments in Python.

`easy_install`, on the other hand, has a smaller user base and is no longer actively maintained. This means that there is less community support available, and it may not be compatible with some of the latest packages and features.


## Conclusion

In conclusion, using `pip` instead of `easy_install` for `python setup.py install` dependency resolution has several benefits, including better handling of package dependencies, better support for virtual environments, better error reporting and debugging, and better community support. Therefore, it is recommended to use `pip` as the default package manager for Python.
