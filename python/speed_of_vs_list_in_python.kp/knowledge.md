tldr: Because [] is a literal notation and list() is a function call, so [] is faster because it is evaluated more quickly.

#1 Advantages of Using []
Using square brackets is a much more efficient way of creating lists in Python than using the list() function. This is because square brackets are a much simpler syntax than the list() function, which requires parentheses and commas. 

#2 Speed
Square brackets are also faster than the list() function. This is because the list() function requires more steps to be taken for each item in the list, while square brackets can be used to create a list of items in a single step.

#3 Memory Usage
Using square brackets is more memory efficient than using the list() function. This is because the list() function requires more memory to store the parentheses and commas, while square brackets only require memory for the items in the list.

#4 Simplicity
Square brackets are also easier to use than the list() function. This is because the syntax for creating a list with square brackets is much simpler than the syntax for creating a list with the list() function. This makes square brackets a better choice for creating lists in Python.
