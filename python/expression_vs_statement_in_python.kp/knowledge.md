### Expression
An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators that evaluates to a single value. It is a combination of symbols that represent a value. In Python, an expression can be a single line statement, or it can span multiple lines.

### Statement
A statement is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. It can contain expressions, and it is used to perform operations such as assignment, control flow, and function calls. Unlike expressions, statements do not evaluate to a single value.
