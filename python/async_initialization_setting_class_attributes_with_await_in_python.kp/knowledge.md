tldr: You cannot use await in the \_\_init\_\_ method as it is not an async function.

Setting Class Attribute with Await in __init__ in Python

The class attribute in Python is a variable that is shared by all instances of the class. Setting a class attribute with await in __init__ requires some specific steps to ensure that the attribute is properly initialized. In this tutorial, we'll discuss the steps to follow to set a class attribute with await in __init__ in Python.

Section 1: Understanding Class Attribute in Python

Before we dive into the steps to set a class attribute with await in __init__, letâ€™s first understand the concept of class attributes in Python. A class attribute is a variable that is defined within a class, but outside any method. This means that the attribute is shared among all instances of the class.

Section 2: Steps to Set Class Attribute with Await in __init__ in Python

To set a class attribute with await in __init__, you need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Define the class and add the __init__ method

Step 2: Declare the class attribute as None

Step 3: Create a coroutine function to set the class attribute value

Step 4: Call the coroutine function using await in the __init__ method

Section 3: Example of Setting Class Attribute with Await in __init__ in Python

Here's an example code snippet that shows how to set a class attribute with await in __init__ in Python:

```python
import asyncio

class MyClass:
    my_class_attribute = None
    
    def __init__(self):
        asyncio.run(self.set_class_attribute_value())
        
    async def set_class_attribute_value(self):
        self.my_class_attribute = 42
```

In this example, we've defined a class named MyClass with a class attribute my_class_attribute set to None. In the __init__ method, we're calling a coroutine function set_class_attribute_value using the asyncio.run() method. This method waits for the coroutine function to complete before continuing with the rest of the code. The set_class_attribute_value() function uses await to set the value of my_class_attribute to 42.

Section 4: Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've discussed how to set a class attribute with await in __init__ in Python. We've explained the concept of class attributes, the steps to follow to set the class attribute value, and provided an example code snippet. By following these steps, you can ensure that your class attributes are correctly initialized with await in Python.
