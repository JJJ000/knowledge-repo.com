# Shape (R, 1)

Shape (R, 1) is a two-dimensional array, where R represents the number of rows and 1 represents the number of columns. It is also referred to as a column vector, as it contains a single column of data.

# Shape (R,)

Shape (R,) is a one-dimensional array, where R represents the number of elements. It is also referred to as a row vector, as it contains a single row of data.

# Difference

The main difference between shape (R, 1) and shape (R,) is the number of dimensions. Shape (R, 1) is a two-dimensional array and shape (R,) is a one-dimensional array. Additionally, shape (R, 1) is a column vector and shape (R,) is a row vector.
