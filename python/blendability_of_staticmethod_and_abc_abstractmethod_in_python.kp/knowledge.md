tldr: Yes, it will blend! `staticmethod` can be used in conjunction with `abc.abstractmethod` to define abstract static methods in Python.

Section 1: Introduction
In Python, `staticmethod` and `abc.abstractmethod` are two different concepts that serve different purposes. `staticmethod` is used to define a method that can be called on a class without requiring an instance while `abc.abstractmethod` is used to define a method that must be implemented in a subclass. In this article, we will explore whether these two concepts can be used together and under what circumstances.

Section 2: Using staticmethod with abc.abstractmethod
`staticmethod` can be used with `abc.abstractmethod` to define a method that can be called without requiring an instance and must be implemented in the subclass. This is useful when we want to define a method that performs a specific task but does not depend on the state of the object. For example, let's define a class `Shape` that has a static method `get_area` and an abstract method `get_perimeter`.

```python
import abc

class Shape(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    
    @staticmethod
    def get_area():
        pass
    
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def get_perimeter(self):
        pass
```

In this example, `get_area` is a static method that calculates the area of a shape and does not depend on the state of the object. On the other hand, `get_perimeter` is an abstract method that must be implemented in the subclass and calculates the perimeter of the shape based on the state of the object.

Section 3: Use cases
One use case for using `staticmethod` with `abc.abstractmethod` is when we want to enforce a certain behavior in the subclass but do not want to rely on the state of the object. For example, let's say we want to define a class `Transaction` that has a static method `validate` and an abstract method `process`. 

```python
import abc

class Transaction(metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    
    @staticmethod
    def validate(transaction_data):
        # validate transaction data here
        pass
    
    @abc.abstractmethod
    def process(self):
        pass
```

In this example, `validate` is a static method that validates transaction data and does not depend on the state of the object. On the other hand, `process` is an abstract method that must be implemented in the subclass and processes the transaction based on the state of the object. 

Section 4: Conclusion
In conclusion, `staticmethod` and `abc.abstractmethod` can be used together in Python to define a method that can be called without requiring an instance and must be implemented in a subclass. This is useful when we want to enforce a certain behavior in the subclass but do not want to rely on the state of the object.
