# Shallow Copy
A shallow copy is a bit-wise copy of an object. It copies the objectâ€™s reference pointers just like a regular assignment statement. A shallow copy creates a new object which stores the reference of the original elements.

# Deep Copy
A deep copy is a bit-wise copy of an object and its sub-objects. It copies the objects and all its sub-objects, making copies of each object. A deep copy creates a new object and recursively adds the copies of the child objects to it.
