Section 1: Introduction
f-strings in Python are a convenient way of formatting strings by embedding expressions inside them. An f-string is defined with the `f` prefix, and expressions are enclosed within curly braces `{ }`.

Section 2: Escaping Curly-Braces in f-Strings
If you need to include curly braces in your f-string, you can escape them by doubling the braces. For example, `{{` and `}}` will be interpreted as literal curly braces instead of placeholders for expressions.

Here's an example:

```
>>> name = "Alice"
>>> message = f"{{Hello, {name}!}}"
>>> print(message)
{Hello, Alice!}
```

As you can see, the doubled braces are interpreted as literal curly braces, and the f-string expression is evaluated as expected.

Section 3: Escaping Curly-Braces within an Expression
If you need to include a literal curly brace inside an expression within an f-string, you can escape it with a backslash `\`. For example, if you want to include the string `"{}"` inside your f-string expression, you can escape the braces like this:

```
>>> num = 42
>>> message = f"{{The answer is: \{{num}}}}"
>>> print(message)
{The answer is: {42}}
```

As you can see, the backslash escapes the curly braces, so that they are interpreted as literal braces within the expression.

Section 4: Conclusion
In this tutorial, we learned how to escape curly braces in f-strings in Python. We saw that we can escape curly braces by doubling them, and we can escape curly braces within expressions with a backslash. These techniques help us to include literal curly braces in our f-strings when we need to use them.
