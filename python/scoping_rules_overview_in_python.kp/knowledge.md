tldr: Python uses lexical scoping, meaning that the scope of a variable is determined by its position in the source code.

# Definition
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is used in many different applications. The scoping rules in Python are the rules that define how variables are accessed and used throughout a program.

# Local Scope
Local scope refers to variables that are only accessible within the function or block of code that they are declared in. When a variable is declared within a function, it is only accessible within that function.

# Global Scope
Global scope refers to variables that are accessible throughout the entire program. Variables declared in the global scope are accessible from any other part of the program.

# Nested Scope
Nested scope refers to variables that are accessible within the scope of a function or block of code that is nested within another function or block of code. These variables are accessible from within the nested function or block of code, but not from outside of it.
