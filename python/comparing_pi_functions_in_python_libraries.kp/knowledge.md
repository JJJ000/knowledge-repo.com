tldr: All three options (scipy.pi, numpy.pi, and math.pi) are equally valid and will return the same value of pi; it depends on your personal preference and the libraries you are using in your code.

Introduction

Python has different libraries that define the constant value of pi. The scipy library uses the pi constant value from the numpy library, which, in turn, uses the math library's constant pi value. In this article, we will discuss which library and constant value of pi we should use in Python and why.

The math Library

The math library is a built-in Python library that defines the standard mathematical functions. It defines the constant value of pi as math.pi. We should use math.pi if we want to perform general-purpose mathematics calculations such as finding the circumference of a circle or calculating the area of a sphere.

The numpy Library

The numpy library is a Python library for scientific computing that provides support for large multi-dimensional arrays and matrices. It defines the constant value of pi as numpy.pi. We should use numpy.pi if we want to perform numerical calculations such as finding the sine or cosine of an angle or performing complex number operations.

The scipy Library

Scipy is an extension of numpy and provides additional functionalities for scientific computing. The scipy library uses the pi constant value from the numpy library, which, in turn, uses the math library's constant pi value. We should use scipy.pi if we want to perform scientific computing that requires the use of both numpy and math libraries.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the choice of which library and constant value of pi to use in Python depends on the type of computations we want to perform. If we want to perform general-purpose mathematics calculations, we should use math.pi. If we want to perform numerical calculations, we should use numpy.pi. If we want to perform scientific computing that requires the use of both numpy and math libraries, we should use scipy.pi.
