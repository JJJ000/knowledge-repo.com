Section 1: Introduction
To check if `sys.stdout` is attached to a terminal or not in Python, we need to use a combination of methods provided by the `os` module and the `sys` module. In this solution, we will explore the steps needed to achieve this goal.

Section 2: Checking if `sys.stdout` is a TTY
To check if `sys.stdout` is a TTY (terminal), we can make use of the `os.isatty()` method. This method checks if the file descriptor associated with a given file object refers to a terminal device or not. We can use this method to check if `sys.stdout` is attached to a terminal or not.

Here is the sample code snippet to check if `sys.stdout` is attached to a terminal:

```python
import os
import sys

if os.isatty(sys.stdout.fileno()):
    # stdout is connected to a terminal
else:
    # stdout is not connected to a terminal
```

Section 3: Explaining the code
In the code above, we first import the required modules: `os` and `sys`. We then use the `os.isatty()` method with `sys.stdout.fileno()` as the argument to check if `sys.stdout` is attached to a terminal. The `fileno()` method returns the file descriptor associated with the file object.

If `os.isatty()` returns `True`, it means `sys.stdout` is attached to a terminal, and if `False`, it means `sys.stdout` is not attached to a terminal.

Section 4: Conclusion
In this solution, we explored how to check if `sys.stdout` is attached to a terminal or not in Python. We used the `os.isatty()` method to achieve this. By using this approach, we can determine whether `sys.stdout` is connected to a terminal or not and perform any necessary actions accordingly.
