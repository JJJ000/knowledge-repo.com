Yes, Scrapy can be used to scrape dynamic content from websites that are using AJAX in Python. 

### Understanding AJAX 

AJAX, short for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, is a technique used by web developers to create dynamic web pages. Instead of the traditional method of loading an entirely new web page every time the user performs an action, AJAX enables web developers to load only the necessary data and update the page on the fly.

### Utilizing Scrapy 

Scrapy, a popular Python-based web scraping framework, uses an asynchronous architecture that can be used for scraping dynamic content, including AJAX-driven websites. Scrapyâ€™s built-in framework allows you to extract data from web pages using DOM parsing and XPath expressions.

### Extracting Dynamic Content 

To extract dynamic content from AJAX-driven websites using Scrapy, you need to know the exact URL of the AJAX endpoint which the website is using to fetch data. Once you identify the endpoint, you can use Scrapy to send an HTTP request, parse the data and extract relevant data using the Scrapy Selector.

### Conclusion 

In conclusion, Scrapy can be used to scrape dynamic content from websites that are using AJAX in Python. However, it requires a good understanding of how AJAX and Scrapy work, and the ability to identify the correct endpoint URL that contains the required data to be scraped. With these skills, you can extract data from AJAX-driven websites seamlessly.
