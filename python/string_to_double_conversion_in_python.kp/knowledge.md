Section 1: Introduction
To convert a string to a double in Python, we need to use a built-in function called 'float()'. This function converts a string to a floating-point number, which is equivalent to a double or a decimal in other programming languages.

Section 2: Converting a String to Float/Double
The process of converting a string to a float/double in Python is very simple. We can use the 'float()' function to perform this operation. Here is an example:

```
my_string = "3.14159"
my_double = float(my_string)
print(my_double)
```

Output:
```
3.14159
```

In the code above, we declared a string variable 'my_string' with a value of "3.14159". We then used the 'float()' function to convert this string to a double and assign it to the 'my_double' variable. Finally, we printed the result, which is '3.14159'.

Section 3: Handling Errors
It's important to note that the 'float()' function may raise a ValueError exception if the string cannot be converted to a floating-point number. For example:

```
my_string = "hello"
my_double = float(my_string)
```

Output:
```
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'hello'
```

To handle this error gracefully, we can use a try-except block:

```
my_string = "hello"
try:
  my_double = float(my_string)
  print(my_double)
except ValueError:
  print("Could not convert the string to a float")
```

Output:
```
Could not convert the string to a float
```

In the code above, we tried to convert a string "hello" to a float using the 'float()' function. However, since "hello" is not a valid floating-point number, the function raised a ValueError exception. We caught this exception using a try-except block and printed an error message instead of the expected double value.

Section 4: Conclusion
In this guide, we learned how to convert a string to a double in Python using the 'float()' function. We also learned how to handle errors that may occur during this conversion. Now that you know how to convert strings to doubles in Python, you can use this knowledge to perform mathematical calculations or manipulate numerical data in your programs.
