# Introduction

Django is a popular open-source web framework for building web applications, written in Python. Sometimes, when starting a Django server, you may encounter an error "port is already in use". This error occurs when the port specified for your Django server is already in use by another process or application on your system. In this article, I will explain how to debug and fix this issue.

# Finding the Process using the Port

The first step in fixing this error is to find which process or application is using the port specified for your Django server. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:
```
sudo lsof -i :8000
```
Here, replace 8000 with the port number you specified in your Django server. Now, you will see a list of processes using the specified port. Find the PID (process identifier) of the process that is using the port and note it down.

# Killing the Process

Now that you have found the process using the specified port, you can kill the process using the following command:
```
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```
Here, replace `<PID>` with the process ID that you noted down in the previous section. This command will forcefully terminate the process that is using the specified port.

# Using a Different Port

If you do not want to kill the process using the specified port, you can start your Django server on a different port by specifying a different port number in your command. For example, you can start the server on port 8080 using the following command:
```
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8080
```
Here, replace 8080 with any other available port number that you want to use.

# Conclusion

In this article, we have seen how to fix the "port is already in use" error in Django. We learned how to find the process using the port, kill the process, and start the server on a different port. I hope this article was informative and helpful.
