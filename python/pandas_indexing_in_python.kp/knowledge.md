## Section 1: Setting the Index
Pandas allows you to set the index of a DataFrame using the `set_index()` method. This method takes a column name as an argument and sets that column as the index of the DataFrame. 

## Section 2: Accessing the Index
Once the index is set, you can access the index column title or name using the `index.name` attribute. 

## Section 3: Changing the Index Name
You can also change the index name by setting the `index.name` attribute to a new name. 

## Section 4: Resetting the Index
Finally, if you want to remove the index and reset it, you can use the `reset_index()` method. This method will return the DataFrame to its original state with the index column removed.
