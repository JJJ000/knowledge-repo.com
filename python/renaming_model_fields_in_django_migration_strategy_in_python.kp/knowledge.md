## Introduction

Renaming a model and its related fields is a common operation in Django development, and it often involves multiple migration steps. In this article, we will outline a migration strategy for this task.

## Step 1: Create a new model and migrate data

The first step is to create a new model with the desired name and fields, and migrate the data from the old model to the new one. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Create a new model with the desired name and fields. Use the `db_table` parameter to specify the table name (if needed). For example:

   ```python
   class NewModel(models.Model):
       # Fields here
       class Meta:
           db_table = "new_model_table"
   ```

2. Create a migration that creates the new table and migrates the data from the old table to the new one. Use the `RunPython` operation to write a custom migration function that performs the data migration. For example:

   ```python
   from django.db import migrations, models

   def migrate_data(apps, schema_editor):
       OldModel = apps.get_model("<app_name>", "OldModel")
       NewModel = apps.get_model("<app_name>", "NewModel")
       for old_obj in OldModel.objects.all():
           new_obj = NewModel()
           new_obj.field1 = old_obj.old_field1
           new_obj.field2 = old_obj.old_field2
           # ...
           new_obj.save()

   class Migration(migrations.Migration):

       dependencies = [
           ("<app_name>", "<previous_migration>"),
       ]

       operations = [
           migrations.CreateModel(
               name="NewModel",
               fields=[
                   # New fields here
               ],
               options={
                   "db_table": "new_model_table",
               },
           ),
           migrations.RunPython(migrate_data),
           # ...
       ]
   ```

3. Run the migration.

   ```
   python manage.py migrate <app_name>
   ```

4. Verify that the data has been migrated correctly.

## Step 2: Create a foreign key relationship

If the renamed model is related to other models through foreign keys, we need to create a new foreign key relationship from the related models to the new model. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Add a foreign key field to the related model that points to the new model. For example:

   ```python
   class RelatedModel(models.Model):
       new_model = models.ForeignKey(
           "NewModel", on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="related_model"
       )
   ```

2. Create a migration that adds the new foreign key field to the related model. For example:

   ```python
   class Migration(migrations.Migration):

       dependencies = [
           ("<app_name>", "<previous_migration>"),
       ]

       operations = [
           migrations.AddField(
               model_name="RelatedModel",
               name="new_model",
               field=models.ForeignKey(
                   on_delete=models.CASCADE,
                   related_name="related_model",
                   to="app_name.NewModel",
               ),
           ),
           # ...
       ]
   ```

3. Run the migration.

   ```
   python manage.py migrate <app_name>
   ```

4. Update any code that references the old foreign key field to use the new foreign key field instead.

## Step 3: Create data migrations for related fields

If we have renamed fields in related models that point to the renamed model, we need to create data migrations to update those fields. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Write a new migration that updates the related fields to use the new model name. Use the `RunPython` operation to write a custom migration function that performs the data migration. For example:

   ```python
   from django.db import migrations, models

   def update_related_field(apps, schema_editor):
       RelatedModel = apps.get_model("<app_name>", "RelatedModel")
       for obj in RelatedModel.objects.all():
           obj.new_model_id = obj.old_model_id
           obj.save(update_fields=["new_model_id"])

   class Migration(migrations.Migration):

       dependencies = [
           ("<app_name>", "<previous_migration>"),
       ]

       operations = [
           migrations.RunPython(update_related_field),
           # ...
       ]
   ```

2. Run the migration.

   ```
   python manage.py migrate <app_name>
   ```

3. Verify that the data has been migrated correctly.

## Conclusion

Renaming a model and its related fields in Django requires careful planning and a multi-step migration process. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can successfully rename your model and related fields while preserving your data integrity.
