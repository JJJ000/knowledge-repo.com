## Introduction to SQLAlchemy ORM and Pandas DataFrame
SQLAlchemy ORM is a Python library that provides an object-relational mapping for working with databases. It allows developers to define data models using Python classes and interact with a database using those objects.

Pandas is another popular library in Python for data manipulation and analysis. It provides a powerful data structure called DataFrame, which is similar to a table in a relational database. The DataFrame allows developers to manipulate data in many ways, including filtering, sorting, and aggregating.

Converting SQLAlchemy ORM to pandas DataFrame is essential because it allows developers to manipulate and analyze data in many ways, making it easier to work with different data sets. 

## Converting SQLAlchemy ORM to pandas DataFrame
To convert SQLAlchemy ORM to pandas DataFrame, we need to follow these steps:

1. Import the required libraries.
2. Create a SQL query using SQLAlchemy ORM.
3. Use the pandas method read_sql_query() to retrieve the SQL query result and store it in a pandas DataFrame.

## Example Code
The following code is an example of how to convert a table from a SQLite database to pandas DataFrame:

```python
import sqlalchemy
import pandas as pd

# Connecting to a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy engine
engine = sqlalchemy.create_engine('sqlite:///example.db')

# Defining a SQL query using SQLAlchemy ORM
query = sqlalchemy.text('SELECT * from example_table')

# Retrieving the query result into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_sql_query(query, engine)

# Printing the first five rows of the DataFrame
print(df.head())
```

In this code, we first import the required libraries (SQLAlchemy and pandas) and connect to a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy engine. We then define a SQL query using SQLAlchemy ORM and retrieve the query result into a pandas DataFrame using pandas method read_sql_query(). Finally, we print the first five rows of the DataFrame using the head() method.

## Conclusion
Converting SQLAlchemy ORM to pandas DataFrame is essential for data manipulation and analysis. It allows developers to work with different data sets in many ways. The process is simple and can be done using pandas method read_sql_query(). Therefore, it is highly recommended that developers learn how to convert SQLAlchemy ORM to pandas DataFrame.
