**Yes, There is a Difference**

**"==" Operator**
The "==" operator is used when the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.

**"is" Operator**
The "is" operator is used to check if both the operands refer to the same object. It returns true if the operands are identical (refer to the same object) and false otherwise.
