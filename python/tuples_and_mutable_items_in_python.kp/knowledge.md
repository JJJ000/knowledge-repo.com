tldr: Tuples can contain mutable items in Python because tuples are immutable containers, but their contents can be mutable.

Section 1: Introduction
In Python, a tuple is defined as an ordered collection of values that are immutable. That means once the tuple is created, its values cannot be changed. However, it is possible to have mutable items inside a tuple, which may seem like a contradiction. This article will explore why this is the case.

Section 2: What is a Mutable Item?
Before we delve into why tuples can contain mutable items, let's first define what mutable means. In programming, a mutable object is one whose value can be changed. Some examples of mutable objects in Python include lists, dictionaries, and sets. Mutable objects are different from immutable objects, which cannot be changed once they have been created.

Section 3: The Difference Between Immutable and Immutable References
One reason tuples can contain mutable items is because of the difference between immutable and mutable references. An immutable reference is a reference to an object whose value cannot be changed. In contrast, a mutable reference is a reference to an object whose value can be changed. When we add a mutable item to a tuple, we are actually adding an immutable reference to that item. This means that the item can still be changed, but the reference to it cannot. 

Section 4: Benefits of Tuples Containing Mutable Items
Having tuples that contain mutable items can be useful in certain situations. For example, if we have a list of objects that we want to keep in a specific order, we could use a tuple to store both the object and its position in the list. This would allow us to keep the list order intact while still being able to modify the objects themselves. Additionally, tuples can be used as keys in dictionaries, which can be helpful when we want to associate specific values with specific objects. 

Section 5: Conclusion
In summary, tuples in Python can contain mutable items because the references to those items are immutable. This can be useful in certain scenarios where we want to keep objects in an ordered collection or use tuples as keys in dictionaries. While tuples are traditionally thought of as immutable, their ability to contain mutable items provides greater flexibility in programming.
