## Step 1: Create a Python Script

The first step is to create a Python script that contains the code you want to execute. This code can do anything from running an analysis to sending an email.

## Step 2: Set Up a Scheduler

The next step is to set up a scheduler to run the Python script. This can be done using the `sched` library in Python. This library allows you to schedule tasks to run at certain times or intervals.

## Step 3: Configure the Scheduler

Once the scheduler is set up, it needs to be configured to run the Python script. This can be done by setting the time and frequency of the task, as well as any other parameters needed.

## Step 4: Execute the Scheduled Job

Finally, the scheduled job can be executed by running the scheduler. This will run the Python script at the specified times and intervals.
