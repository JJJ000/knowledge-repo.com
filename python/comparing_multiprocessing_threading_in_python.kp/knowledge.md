tldr: Multiprocessing is used to run multiple processes simultaneously, while threading is used to run multiple threads within a single process.

# Multiprocessing
Multiprocessing is the use of multiple processes to execute a task. This is done by running multiple instances of a program at the same time. Each process runs independently of the others and can access different resources. This allows for more efficient use of system resources and faster completion of tasks.

# Threading
Threading is the use of multiple threads to execute a task. This is done by running multiple instances of a program within a single process. Each thread shares the same memory space and can access the same resources. This allows for more efficient use of system resources and faster completion of tasks.

# Advantages of Multiprocessing
Multiprocessing allows for more efficient use of system resources. Each process can access different resources and run independently of the others. This makes it ideal for tasks that require more than one processor or that require access to different resources.

# Advantages of Threading
Threading allows for more efficient use of system resources. Each thread can access the same resources and run within the same process. This makes it ideal for tasks that require multiple threads to execute a single task or that require access to the same resources.
