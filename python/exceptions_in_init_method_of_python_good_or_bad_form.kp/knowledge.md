Introduction
As an AI language model, I donâ€™t have personal experiences or opinions, but I can provide the necessary information that can assist you as a user. In this case, I will explain whether it is a bad form to raise exceptions within __init__ in Python or not.

Exceptions in Python
Python has a robust and structured approach to exceptions. Exceptions can be raised on purpose, and they occur when an error occurs in a program. Exceptions are useful since they can diagnose errors in software, making Python code less susceptible to bugs or runtime errors.

__init__ Method in Python

The __init__ method is a special method within Python that is called after an instance of an object is created. It is used to initialize an object with the required attributes or arguments.

Is it bad form to raise exceptions within __init__?
The answer to this question is not so clear-cut. Raising exceptions within __init__ can be a good and bad practice depending on the situation. 

When is it good to raise exceptions within __init__?
In some cases, it is appropriate to create an instance of a class, but the inputs are incorrect. For example, if a class requires a specific type of inputs, and you pass data of the wrong data type or structure. In this case, it is good practice to raise an exception within __init__. This will alert the user that they need to input the correct data so that the instance is created appropriately.

When is it bad to raise exceptions within __init__?
Raising an exception within __init__ is bad practice when the error is beyond the control of the user. For instance, if the exception raised in __init__ is due to environmental factors like low memory or CPU, it might not make sense to raise an exception since there is nothing the user can do to control those factors.

Conclusion
Raising exceptions within __init__ method can be a good or bad practice depending on the situation. It is good practice to raise exceptions when the user inputs incorrect data, but it is terrible practice to raise exceptions when the error is beyond the user's control. Hence, it is always essential to consider the nature of the problem before raising an exception.
