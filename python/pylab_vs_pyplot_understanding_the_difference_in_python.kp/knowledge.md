tldr: Pyplot is a module from the matplotlib library that provides a high-level interface for creating visualizations, while pylab is a module that combines pyplot with NumPy into a single namespace for ease of use.

## Introduction
Python is a popular open-source programming language that is widely used in various fields such as data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing. The Python scientific computing community provides a variety of libraries and tools to enable scientists and researchers to analyze, visualize, and explore data. Two such libraries commonly used in Python for scientific computing are `pylab` and `pyplot`. Despite belonging to the same family of libraries, these two have differences.

## What is Pylab?
`pylab` is a library that provides a MATLAB-like interface to Python's numerical and plotting libraries. It is a high-level module built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib. Pylab provides an easy to use interface that is familiar to MATLAB users. One can use Pylab to create a plot with a single line of code.

## What is Pyplot?
`pyplot` is a module of the matplotlib library that provides a collection of functions that allows plotting different types of data. Pyplot is a collection of functions that can be used to create a variety of charts such as line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, and histograms. This module provides a low-level interface to the matplotlib library that allows for greater control and customization of the output.

## Differences between Pylab and Pyplot
The primary difference between `pylab` and `pyplot` is that `pylab` has a higher-level interface with a MATLAB-like syntax, whereas `pyplot` provides a lower-level interface that is more flexible, but requires a more verbose syntax. 

`pylab` provides a MATLAB-like interface to Python's numerical and plotting libraries. It is a simpler and more expressive interface to generate plots quickly. Pylab is useful for interactive exploration and when you want to quickly visualize something without worrying too much about the details.

 `pyplot` is a part of the matplotlib library and provides a collection of functions that support generating plots. Pyplot, on the other hand, provides granular control over the plot generation and can be used for generating complex plots. Once you master pyplot, it becomes easier to embed your matplotlib visualizations in web applications or exported to different image formats.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, `pylab` and `pyplot` serve the same purpose, i.e., data visualization, but through different interfaces. While `pylab` provides a simpler interface, `pyplot` gives you more granular control and customization options. The choice between the two depends on the user's needs, such as the type of plot they want to create, the amount of control over the plot they require, etc.
