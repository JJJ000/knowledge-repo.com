# Introduction 

`tf.app.run()` is a function in Python that is commonly used to start a `tensorflow` program. It is used as the main entry point of the program and provides a way to configure and start a `tensorflow` session. In this article, we will discuss the working of `tf.app.run()` function in detail.

# Understanding tf.app.run()

`tf.app.run()` is a convenience function provided by the `tensorflow` library. It is used to start a `tensorflow` program and runs the TensorFlow graph that has been constructed in the program.

The `tf.app.run()` function has the following structure:

```
tf.app.run(main=None, argv=None)
```

The `main` parameter is the function that will be called by `tf.app.run()`. This function should build the computation graph and define the training loop. The `argv` parameter is used to pass command-line arguments to the program.

When `tf.app.run()` is called, it creates a `tensorflow` session and runs the `main` function. It passes the session and command-line arguments to the `main` function. The `main` function can then use the session to run the computation graph and train the model.

# Example

Here is an example of how `tf.app.run()` can be used to start a program:

```
import tensorflow as tf

def main(_):
    # build computation graph and define training loop
    pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    tf.app.run(main=main)
```

In this example, we define a `main()` function and pass it as an argument to `tf.app.run()`. We also use `if __name__ == '__main__':` to ensure that the `main()` function is only executed if the script is run directly, and not when it is imported as a module.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, `tf.app.run()` is a convenience function provided by `tensorflow` to start a program and run the computation graph that has been defined in the program. It creates a session, passes command-line arguments, and runs the `main()` function. Understanding how `tf.app.run()` works is important for building `tensorflow` programs.
