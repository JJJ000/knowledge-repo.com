tldr: Python has no maximum float value as it depends on the system`s floating-point implementation and available memory.

Python Float Numbers

Python float is a numeric data type that represents decimal numbers. Float values in Python can be expressed using a decimal point, scientific notation or some other ways.

Maximum Float in Python

Python float is implemented using the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic. The maximum possible value for a Python float depends on the implementation and the machine. 

Python's float uses 64 bits to store the value, and it follows the IEEE 754 standard, which specifies the maximum value for a single-precision (32-bit) float as 3.40282347 × 10⁴⁸ and for a double-precision (64-bit) float as 1.7976931348623157 × 10³⁰⁸. Therefore, the maximum float in Python is:

1.7976931348623157 × 10³⁰⁸.

Note that exceeding this value can result in overflow errors.
