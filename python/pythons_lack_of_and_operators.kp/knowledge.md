tldr: Python does not have ++ and -- operators because it is a language that emphasizes readability and simplicity.

# Lack of Necessity
Python does not require the use of the increment and decrement operators (++ and --) due to the fact that it is a high-level language. This means that it is more abstract than a low-level language like assembly and has more features that allow for easier manipulation of data. Python has built-in functions and methods that can be used to increment and decrement variables, such as the += and -= operators.

# Readability
The use of increment and decrement operators can make code harder to read and understand. Since Python is designed to be an easily readable language, the developers of the language decided to omit these operators. This allows for code to be more easily understood by other developers.

# Performance
The use of increment and decrement operators can also lead to a decrease in performance. This is because the operators require the interpreter to perform additional operations in order to execute the code. By omitting these operators, the interpreter can execute the code more efficiently.
