# Section 1: Importing the Requests Library

The first step is to import the requests library. This is a Python library used to make HTTP requests.

```python
import requests
```

# Section 2: Making the Request

Once the requests library is imported, a request can be made to the URL of the image. This will return a response object.

```python
response = requests.get(image_url)
```

# Section 3: Checking the Response

It is important to check the response status code to make sure that the request was successful. A status code of 200 indicates that the request was successful.

```python
if response.status_code == 200:
    # proceed with downloading the image
else:
    # handle the error
```

# Section 4: Downloading the Image

Once the response status code is verified, the image can be downloaded by writing the response content to a file.

```python
with open('image.jpg', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```
