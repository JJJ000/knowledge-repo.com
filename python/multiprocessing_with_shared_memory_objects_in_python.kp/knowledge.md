Section 1: Introduction to Shared-Memory Objects in Python multiprocessing

Python multiprocessing module enables the developers to execute multiple processes concurrently. With multiprocessing, each process has its memory space, and there is no sharing of memory. However, in some cases, it becomes necessary for two or more processes to share data. In such scenarios, Python multiprocessing provides a facility to create shared-memory objects that enable different processes to write and read data in a shared memory location. 

Section 2: Benefits of Shared-Memory Objects 

Shared-memory objects can be beneficial in many ways, such as:

- They can help in reducing the copying overhead when communicating data between two or more processes. 

- They allow multiple processes to access and modify the same data simultaneously, which can help in improving the performance and reducing synchronization overhead. 

- They enable implementation of lock-free algorithms, which can further enhance the performance of multiprocessing applications. 

Section 3: Creating Shared-Memory Objects

Python multiprocessing provides different classes for creating shared-memory objects, such as Value and Array. The Value class is used for creating a single shared variable of a particular datatype, while the Array class is used for creating a shared array of a particular datatype.

Here is an example of creating a shared variable of type integer using the Value class:

```python
from multiprocessing import Value, Process

def worker(shared_var):
    shared_var.value += 1
    print(f'The value of shared_var is {shared_var.value}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    shared_var = Value('i', 0)
    processes = [Process(target=worker, args=(shared_var,)) for _ in range(4)]
    for p in processes:
        p.start()
    for p in processes:
        p.join()
```

In this example, a shared variable of type integer is created using the Value class. The value of the shared variable is initially set to 0. Four processes are created, and each process increments the value of the shared variable by one. The print statement shows the updated value of the shared variable. 

Section 4: Conclusion 

Shared-memory objects in Python multiprocessing provide a powerful mechanism for interprocess communication in a multiprocessing environment. They enable the implementation of efficient and highly-performance multiprocessing applications. Shared-memory objects can be used to create shared variables and arrays that can be accessed and modified by different processes. Python multiprocessing provides different classes, such as Value and Array, for creating shared-memory objects.
