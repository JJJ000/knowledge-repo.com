tldr: The most efficient way is to iterate from 1 to the square root of the number and check if the number is divisible by the current iteration, adding both the quotient and divisor as factors.

# Section 1: Using for loop to find factors

The most efficient way of finding all the factors of a number in Python is to use a for loop. We can iterate through all the numbers from 1 to the given number and check if the number is a factor. If it is a factor, we can add it to a list of factors. 

Here's the code to implement this approach:

```python
def find_factors(num):
    factors = []
    for i in range(1, num+1):
        if num % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
    return factors
```

# Section 2: Using math.sqrt() to optimize the for loop

The above approach works fine, but we can optimize it further by reducing the range of numbers we iterate over. We know that factors always come in pairs. If x is a factor of num, then num/x is also a factor. So, we only need to iterate up to the square root of the given number.

Here's the optimized code:

```python
import math

def find_factors(num):
    factors = []
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(num))+1):
        if num % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            if i != num/i:
                factors.append(num/i)
    return factors
```

# Section 3: Using list comprehension to further optimize

We can further optimize the code by using list comprehension instead of a for loop. List comprehension is faster than a for loop because it avoids the overhead of calling a function to append to a list.

Here's the optimized code using list comprehension:

```python
import math

def find_factors(num):
    factors = [i for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(num))+1) if num % i == 0]
    factors += [num/i for i in factors if i != num/i]
    return factors
```

# Section 4: Summary

In summary, the most efficient way to find all the factors of a number in Python is to use a combination of for loop, math.sqrt(), and list comprehension. By iterating over only the square root of the given number, and by using list comprehension, we can optimize the code for performance.
