tldr: `Killed` means the process was terminated by the operating system, usually due to exceeding the memory limit or taking too long to execute.

# Introduction 

Processing a huge CSV file in Python can be a daunting task, especially when dealing with large datasets. Unfortunately, it's not uncommon for such code to hit a roadblock and suddenly stop midway. In this article, we'll look at what 'killed' means when processing a huge CSV file with Python.


## What is 'killed' in Python CSV processing?

Python CSV processing is a resource-intensive task that requires a lot of memory and CPU power. In many cases, the operating system may decide to stop the Python script from running to prevent it from consuming all available resources. When this happens, the Python process is said to be 'killed,' which means that the OS has terminated it for the user's safety.


## Reasons for Python CSV Processing being killed

Python CSV processing being killed are caused by various reasons like Resource exhaustion,Memory Leak Issues, System Limitations 

# Resource Exhaustion 

Resource exhaustion occurs when the Python script consumes more resources, such as memory or CPU cycles, than what is available on the system. In such cases, the OS might decide to kill the Python process to prevent it from causing further damage to the system. 

# Memory Leak Issues

Memory leak occurs when the Python script stores data or objects in memory and does not release them, leading to an increase in memory usage over time. Over time the memory being used up will lead to system hanging and crash, thereby leading to termination of the process. 

# System Limitations 

System limitations occur when the Python script tries to access resources or perform operations that are restricted by the OS. For instance, In the case of a system having a file size limit, if the CSV file processed is more than the allowed limit, the system will terminate the Python process. 

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the term "killed" in Python CSV processing means the OS has terminated the process to prevent resource exhaustion, memory leaks, or system limitations. It is important to keep in mind that killing a Python process during CSV processing is not uncommon and is often the result of an inefficient implementation of code. By handling errors effectively, optimizing the code, and monitoring resources can help mitigate the chances of Python process getting killed during CSV processing.
