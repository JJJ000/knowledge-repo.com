tldr: One possible way to quantify the difference between two images in Python is by computing their root mean square error (RMSE).

Section 1: Introduction
Image comparison is the method of determining the dissimilarity or similarity of two or more images. Quantifying the difference between two images is an essential task in image processing, and it has a wide range of applications, including medical diagnosis, object detection, facial recognition, and image retrieval. Python is a popular programming language used in image processing and has many libraries to compare images.

Section 2: Image Comparison Metrics
Several image comparison metrics are used to measure the difference between two images. Each measure has its advantages and limitations, and the choice of the measure depends on the specific task at hand. Some common measures are:

1. Root Mean Square Error: This measure calculates the difference between two images by calculating the difference between the pixel values in each image. It is calculated by summing the square of the pixel value differences and taking the square root.

2. Mean Absolute Error: This measure calculates the absolute difference between the pixel values in two images and takes the average of those values.

3. Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM): This measure compares the structural similarity between two images. It compares the luminance, contrast, and structure of the images and provides a value between 0 and 1 that represents the similarity between the images.

4. Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR): This measure calculates the similarity between two images based on their peak signal-to-noise ratio. It provides a measure of the ratio between the maximum possible power of a signal and the power of corrupting noise.

Section 3: Implementing Image Comparison in Python
To compare images in Python, we can use the Pillow library, which is a fork of the Python Imaging Library (PIL). Pillow provides several image comparison metrics, including MSE, PSNR, and SSIM. In addition, there are other libraries such as OpenCV and scikit-image that have image comparison functions.

Here is an example of implementing image comparison using Pillow:

```
from PIL import Image, ImageChops

# open the images
image1 = Image.open('image1.png')
image2 = Image.open('image2.png')

# calculate the difference between the images
diff = ImageChops.difference(image1, image2)

# get the RMS value
rms = ImageChops.RMS(diff)

print('RMS value:', rms)
```

In this example, we first open two images, 'image1.png' and 'image2.png.' We then calculate the difference between the images using the ImageChops function. Finally, we calculate the RMS value using the ImageChops function.

Section 4: Conclusion
Comparing images in Python is an essential task in image processing. Several image comparison metrics are used to measure the difference between two images, including RMSE, PSNR, and SSIM. Python has several libraries such as Pillow, OpenCV, and scikit-image that can be used to implement image comparison.
