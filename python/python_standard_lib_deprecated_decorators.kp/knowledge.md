# Introduction

The Python standard library is a collection of modules that come pre-installed with every Python installation. These modules provide a wide range of functionality, from file I/O to network communication to mathematical operations. One particularly useful feature of the standard library is the inclusion of decorators, such as @deprecated.


# What is a decorator?

In Python, a decorator is a function that takes another function and extends the behavior of the latter function without explicitly modifying its code. The decorator wraps the original function and allows additional functionality to be added before or after the function's execution. Decorators are commonly used to add debugging functionality, enforcing security restrictions, and other similar use cases.


# @deprecated decorator

One useful decorator that is included in the Python standard library is the @deprecated decorator. This decorator can be used to mark a function or method as deprecated, which means that it is no longer recommended for use and may be removed in a future release.

When a user attempts to use a deprecated function or method, they will receive a warning message alerting them to the deprecation. This can be useful in guiding users to updated code and reducing the likelihood of unexpected behavior as libraries evolve.


# Example usage

To use the @deprecated decorator, simply import it from the `warnings` module and add it to the function or method you wish to deprecate. Here is an example:

```
import warnings

@warnings.warn('This function is deprecated. Use new_function() instead.')
def old_function():
    # Deprecated function code goes here
    pass
```

When a user attempts to call this function, they will receive a warning message like the following:

```
DeprecationWarning: This function is deprecated. Use new_function() instead.
```

This allows users to take action to update their code and reduce potential issues in future releases.
