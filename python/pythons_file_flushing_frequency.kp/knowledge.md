tldr: Python flushes to a file based on the buffering mode, but typically will buffer up to a certain amount of data before automatically flushing.

## Python buffering

In order to optimize performance, Python uses a buffering mechanism that delays the act of writing data to a file until either the buffer gets too full or the file is closed. This can result in data not being written immediately to a file, which can be problematic in certain situations.

## Flush method

To force Python to write data to a file immediately, a developer can use the `flush` method. This method sends any buffered data to the file and clears the buffer, which ensures that the data is saved to the file. Depending on the nature of the code, calling the `flush` method can be done at different points in the program.

## Default Python flush behavior

By default, Python flushes the buffer to the file whenever the buffer reaches a certain size or when the file is explicitly closed. This behavior can be modified by setting the buffer size or by configuring the file object to use unbuffered writes.

## Conclusion

In general, Python flushes data to a file automatically when the buffer gets too full or when the file is closed. However, it is sometimes necessary to call the `flush` method in order to force data to be written immediately. By understanding the default behavior of Python buffering, developers can optimize their programs for performance and reliability.
