tldr: Python 3.x requires strings as input to certain functions and methods, whereas bytes inputs are often accepted in Python 2.x.

Section 1: Introduction
One common error that Python developers run into is the "builtins.TypeError: must be str, not bytes" error. This error typically occurs when there is a mismatch between a string type and a bytes type. In this article, we'll discuss some of the common causes of this error and provide some solutions that you can use to resolve it.

Section 2: Common Causes of the "builtins.TypeError: must be str, not bytes" Error
One common cause of this error is attempting to concatenate a string with a bytes object. For example, suppose you have a bytes object representing a file and you attempt to concatenate it with a string. Python will raise the "builtins.TypeError: must be str, not bytes" error because it cannot concatenate a bytes object with a string object.

Another common cause of this error is due to encoding. If you're attempting to encode or decode a bytes object, and you do not specify the correct encoding method, then you may encounter this error. For example, if you attempt to decode a bytes object using the ASCII encoding method, but the original string was encoded using the UTF-8 encoding method, then you will see this error.

Section 3: Solutions for the "builtins.TypeError: must be str, not bytes" Error
If you encounter this error, there are several solutions that you can use to resolve it. Here are a few of the most common solutions:

- Convert bytes to string: If you have a bytes object that you need to concatenate with a string, you can convert the bytes object to a string using the "decode()" method. For example, "bytes_object.decode()". This will convert the bytes object to a string and allow you to concatenate it with other strings.
- Specify the correct encoding method: If you are encoding or decoding a bytes object and receiving this error, ensure that you're specifying the correct encoding method. For example, if you're decoding a bytes object that was encoded using the UTF-8 method, you should specify the "utf-8" encoding method.
- Use "bytes" instead of "str": Finally, you can use the "bytes" type instead of the "str" type if your code requires a bytes object. This may involve updating your code to use bytes instead of strings.

Section 4: Conclusion
In this article, we've discussed the "builtins.TypeError: must be str, not bytes" error and some of the common causes of this error. We also provided several solutions for resolving this error, including converting bytes to a string, specifying the correct encoding method and using bytes instead of strings. By using these solutions, you should be able to resolve this error and ensure that your code runs smoothly.
