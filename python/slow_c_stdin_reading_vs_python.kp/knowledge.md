tldr: C++ requires more code to process input from stdin than Python, making it slower.

# Compiler Optimization

C++ is a compiled language, meaning that its code must be translated into machine code before it can be executed. This process is known as compilation and is done by a compiler. The compiler can optimize the code in order to improve its performance, but the optimization process is limited by the complexity of the code. Python, on the other hand, is an interpreted language, meaning that its code is executed directly, without being compiled. This allows for more complex optimization techniques, which can result in faster execution times.

# Data Structures

The data structures used to store the input data can also have an effect on the speed of the program. In C++, the standard library provides a number of data structures which can be used for storing data. However, these data structures are not optimized for reading from standard input, which can lead to slower execution times. Python, on the other hand, has its own optimized data structures which are designed to make reading from standard input faster and more efficient.

# Algorithms

The algorithms used to process the input data can also affect the speed of the program. In C++, the standard library provides a number of algorithms which can be used for processing data. However, these algorithms are not always optimized for reading from standard input, which can lead to slower execution times. Python, on the other hand, has its own optimized algorithms which are designed to make reading from standard input faster and more efficient.

# Memory Management

Finally, the way that memory is managed can also have an effect on the speed of the program. In C++, the standard library provides a number of functions for managing memory, but these functions are often not optimized for reading from standard input, which can lead to slower execution times. Python, on the other hand, has its own optimized memory management functions which are designed to make reading from standard input faster and more efficient.
