# Definition

NumPy is a library for the Python programming language that provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays. The two main objects in NumPy are ndarray and array. 

# ndarray

An ndarray is a multidimensional array object that stores homogeneous data in a grid-like structure. It is the fundamental building block of the NumPy library and is used to store and manipulate data in an efficient way. It is an object that contains data of the same type and size.

# array

The array is a derived object of the ndarray. It is a sub-class of ndarray and has the same methods and attributes as the ndarray, but it is more flexible and can be used to store different data types. It is used to represent vectors, matrices, and higher-dimensional datasets in a compact form.
