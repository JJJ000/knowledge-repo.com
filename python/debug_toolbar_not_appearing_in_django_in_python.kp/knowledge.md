# Introduction
Django Debug Toolbar is a powerful tool for debugging Django applications. It provides detailed information about the request/response cycle, SQL queries, and other debugging information. However, in some cases, the toolbar may not show up, even after proper installation and configuration. In this article, we will explore some common issues that can cause the Django Debug Toolbar to fail to display and provide solutions on how to fix them.

# Possible issues and solutions

## 1. Debug mode is disabled
 The Django Debug Toolbar only works when Debug mode is enabled in your Django application's settings. If Debug mode is disabled, then the toolbar will not appear. To enable Debug mode, ensure that `DEBUG=True` is included in your application's settings.

## 2. Networking issues
 Django Debug Toolbar requires access to the network to serve its resources. If there are networking issues or connectivity problems, then the toolbar may fail to appear. To check if this is the case, try accessing the Django Debug Toolbar's resources directly via the browser's address bar. The toolbar's resources can be found under `/static/debug_toolbar/`.

 If the resources are inaccessible, check if the `STATIC_URL` is set correctly and that they are accessible from the server. If the resources are accessible, the issue may be with caching in the browser, and a hard refresh or clearing the browser cache should resolve it.

## 3. Middleware configuration
 To use Django Debug Toolbar, it needs to be added to the middleware list in your application's settings. The toolbar can be added as follows:
```
MIDDLEWARE = [
    # ...
    'debug_toolbar.middleware.DebugToolbarMiddleware',
    # ...
]
```
 Ensure that the toolbar is included in the correct order; it should appear after any GZip or caching middleware but before any other middleware. Also, make sure that any WSGI middleware, like Sentry or Whitenoise, do not interfere with the toolbar's middleware.

## 4. Versions mismatch issues
 Django Debug Toolbar supports specific versions of Django, and there may be compatibility issues in case an incompatible version is used. To verify the compatibility, check the Django Debug Toolbar's documentation version and compare it with your Django's version. It is recommended to use the same version of Django and the Django Debug Toolbar to avoid any compatibility issues.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the Django Debug Toolbar is an excellent tool for debugging Django applications. However, it may not function as expected due to some issues which need to be resolved. This article has described some possible causes of the Django Debug Toolbar's failure to appear and provided some solutions on how to fix these issues. By following these solutions, the Django Debug Toolbar should function correctly and provide you with useful debugging information.
