tldr: Tuples are immutable, so there is no way to modify them within a comprehension.

# Lack of Necessity
Tuples are an immutable form of a list, meaning that they cannot be changed. Therefore, there is no need for a comprehension syntax for tuples, as they are already immutable and do not require a comprehension syntax to be created. 

# Syntax Confusion
The syntax for list comprehensions is already quite complex, and adding a comprehension syntax for tuples would add to the complexity of the syntax. This could lead to confusion for new programmers who are trying to learn the language. 

# Performance Issues
Adding a comprehension syntax for tuples would require additional overhead for the Python interpreter, which could lead to a decrease in performance. This could be especially concerning for programs that rely on performance, such as those in the scientific computing field. 

# Compatibility
Adding a comprehension syntax for tuples could also lead to compatibility issues with existing code. This could be especially problematic for code that relies on the existing syntax for list comprehensions.
