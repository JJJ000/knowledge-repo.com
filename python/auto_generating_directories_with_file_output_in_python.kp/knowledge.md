tldr: Using the os module, you can create directories automatically and write files to them using the open() function.

# Section 1: Setup

In order to automatically create directories with file output in Python, you will need to import the `os` and `os.path` modules.

```python
import os
import os.path
```

# Section 2: Creating Directories

Once the modules have been imported, you can use the `os.makedirs()` function to create directories. The syntax for this function is as follows:

```python
os.makedirs(path, mode=0o777, exist_ok=False)
```

The `path` argument is the path of the directory you want to create. The `mode` argument is the file permission mode for the directory, and the `exist_ok` argument is a boolean value that determines whether a directory should be created if it already exists.

# Section 3: Writing Files

Once the directory has been created, you can use the `open()` function to write a file in the new directory. The syntax for this function is as follows:

```python
open(file, mode='w', buffering=-1, encoding=None, errors=None, newline=None, closefd=True, opener=None)
```

The `file` argument is the path of the file you want to create. The `mode` argument is the mode in which the file should be opened. The other arguments are optional and can be used to specify additional parameters.

# Section 4: Putting it All Together

Here is an example of how to use the `os.makedirs()` and `open()` functions to automatically create directories and write files in Python:

```python
import os
import os.path

# Create the directory
os.makedirs('/path/to/my/directory', exist_ok=True)

# Open the file
f = open('/path/to/my/directory/file.txt', 'w')

# Write to the file
f.write('Hello, world!')

# Close the file
f.close()
```
