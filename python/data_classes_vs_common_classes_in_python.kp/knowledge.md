tldr: Data classes are classes specifically designed to store data, and are different from common classes in Python in that they require less code to create and have additional features such as default values and type hints.

# Introduction
Data classes are a feature of the Python programming language that allow users to create classes that store data. They are a convenient way to create classes that contain only data and no methods or other code. Data classes are different from common classes in Python in that they are simpler to create and use, and are optimized for storing data.

# Simplicity
Data classes are much simpler to create than common classes in Python. They do not require a constructor, and all attributes can be defined in a single line of code. This makes them easier to use and more compact than common classes.

# Optimization
Data classes are optimized for storing data. They are designed to be used as structures for storing data, and as such, they are optimized for this purpose. This makes them more efficient than common classes, which are not optimized for this purpose.

# Limitations
Data classes have some limitations compared to common classes. They cannot contain methods or code, and they cannot be used to create instances of other classes. This makes them less versatile than common classes, but they are still useful for storing data.
