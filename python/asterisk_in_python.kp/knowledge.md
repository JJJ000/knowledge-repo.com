# Definition

In Python, an asterisk (*) is a symbol used for multiplication, as well as for the power operator and for unpacking iterables like lists and tuples.

# Usage in Multiplication

The asterisk can be used to multiply two numbers together. For example, `2 * 3` would be evaluated as 6.

# Usage in Power Operator

The asterisk can also be used to represent the power operator. For example, `2 ** 3` would be evaluated as 8.

# Usage in Unpacking Iterables

The asterisk can be used to unpack iterables like lists and tuples. For example, `a, *b, c = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` would assign the value 1 to the variable `a`, the values 2, 3, 4 to the list `b`, and the value 5 to the variable `c`.
