# Section 1: Using the exec() Function

The exec() function is a built-in function in Python that can be used to execute a string containing Python code. This function takes a string as an argument and executes it as if it were a normal Python program.

# Section 2: Using the eval() Function

The eval() function is another built-in function in Python that can be used to execute a string containing Python code. This function takes a string as an argument and evaluates the expression or statement contained in the string.

# Section 3: Using the compile() Function

The compile() function is a built-in function in Python that can be used to compile a string containing Python code into a code object. This code object can then be executed using the exec() function.

# Section 4: Using the execfile() Function

The execfile() function is a built-in function in Python that can be used to execute a file containing Python code. This function takes a file name as an argument and executes the code contained in the file.
