# Section 1: Importing the Necessary Modules

In order to read JSON from a file in Python, we must first import the necessary modules. The `json` module provides us with the necessary functions for reading and writing JSON data.

```python
import json
```

# Section 2: Opening and Reading the File

Once we have imported the necessary modules, we can open and read the file. We can do this using the `open()` function. This will return a `file` object which we can then use to read the contents of the file.

```python
with open('data.json') as json_file:
    data = json.load(json_file)
```

# Section 3: Accessing the Data

Once we have read the contents of the file, we can access the data by using the `data` variable. This will return a `dict` object which we can use to access the data.

```python
name = data['name']
age = data['age']
```

# Section 4: Closing the File

Finally, we must close the file once we are done with it. We can do this using the `close()` method on the `file` object.

```python
json_file.close()
```
