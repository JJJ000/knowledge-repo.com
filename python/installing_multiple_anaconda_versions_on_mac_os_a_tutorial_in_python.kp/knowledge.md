# Introduction 
Anaconda is a popular distribution of the Python programming language that includes common scientific libraries and tools for data analysis. It is useful for tasks such as machine learning, scientific computing, and data analysis. This guide will show you how to install two versions of Anaconda, one for Python 2 and one for Python 3, on your Mac OS computer.

# Installing Anaconda for Python 2
1. Go to the Anaconda website and download the installation file for Python 2.
2. Double-click on the downloaded file to open the installation wizard.
3. Follow the prompts in the wizard to install Anaconda.
4. When prompted, choose to install Anaconda for all users and add Anaconda to your PATH environment variable.

# Installing Anaconda for Python 3
1. Go to the Anaconda website and download the installation file for Python 3.
2. Double-click on the downloaded file to open the installation wizard.
3. Follow the prompts in the wizard to install Anaconda.
4. When prompted, choose to install Anaconda for all users and add Anaconda to your PATH environment variable.

# Conclusion
Once you have installed both versions of Anaconda, you can switch between them by activating the appropriate environment. To activate the Python 2 environment, open a terminal and type `source activate python2`. To activate the Python 3 environment, type `source activate python3`. You can then use the `conda` command to manage packages for that environment.
