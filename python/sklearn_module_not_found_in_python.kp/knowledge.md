What is the ImportError?

When there is a module not found error in Python, it implies that the interpreter is not able to locate the module specified by our program. There might be various reasons behind this error, some of which include:

- The module is not installed properly
- The module is not installed at all
- The module is not present in the current working directory of the Python interpreter.

What is Sklearn?

Scikit-Learn, also known as sklearn, is a popular python library that provides various tools for data analysis and data mining. It is built on top of numpy, scipy, and matplotlib, three popular Python libraries for scientific computing, and provides various machine learning algorithms like classification, regression, and clustering.

Why is Sklearn not found?

If you encounter the “ModuleNotFoundError: No module named ‘sklearn’” error message it, there may be a few reasons why sklearn could not be found on your system. These include:

- Sklearn is not installed
- Sklearn is installed, but the system is unable to access it
- There’s a naming issue: you might need to install “scikit-learn” instead of “sklearn”

How to fix the Sklearn ModuleNotFoundError?

To fix the ModuleNotFoundError, we need to install sklearn:

- Open your command prompt on your computer
- Type “pip install -U scikit-learn” and hit Enter
- Wait for the installation to get completed
- After installation is finished, close your command prompt, restart your Python environment or IDE, and import sklearn in your Python code

You should now be able to use scikit-learn functions and objects in your Python script, and the “ModuleNotFoundError: No module named ‘sklearn’” should no longer appear.
