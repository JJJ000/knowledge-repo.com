# Installation Steps

## Prerequisites
Before installing pip, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your machine. If you do not have Python 3 installed, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Downloading pip
Pip is included with Python 3, so you do not need to download it separately.

## Installing pip
To install pip, open a terminal window and type `python3 -m ensurepip --default-pip`. This will install pip for the current user.

## Verifying Installation
To verify that pip has been installed correctly, open a terminal window and type `pip3 -V`. This should output the version of pip installed on your machine.
