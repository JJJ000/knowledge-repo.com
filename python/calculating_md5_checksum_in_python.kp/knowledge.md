tldr: Use the hashlib library and its md5() method to calculate the MD5 checksum of the file.

[TOC]

## Importing hashlib module

First, you need to import the `hashlib` module in Python. The `hashlib` module provides various hash functions. In this case, we will be using the `md5()` function provided by this module.

``` python
import hashlib
```

## Reading the file

To calculate the MD5 checksum of a file in Python, you must first open the file and read its content. Here is how to read the content of a file and store it in a variable:

``` python
with open('file_to_checksum.txt', 'rb') as f:
    data = f.read()
```

## Calculating the MD5 checksum

Once you've read the data from the file, you can calculate the MD5 checksum using the `md5()` method provided by the `hashlib` module.

``` python
md5_checksum = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()
```

The `hexdigest()` method is used to get the hexadecimal representation of the MD5 checksum.

## Full example

Here is the complete code for calculating the MD5 checksum of a file in Python:

``` python
import hashlib

with open('file_to_checksum.txt', 'rb') as f:
    data = f.read()

md5_checksum = hashlib.md5(data).hexdigest()

print('MD5 checksum:', md5_checksum)
``` 

*Note: Replace `file_to_checksum.txt` with the name of the file you want to calculate the MD5 checksum for.*
