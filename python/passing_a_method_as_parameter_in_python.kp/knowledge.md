tldr: In Python, you can pass a method as a parameter by simply referencing the method name without using parentheses to call it.

## Introduction
Python is a dynamically typed language which means it is flexible in its function call arguments. One way to pass a method as a parameter in Python is through the use of function objects, which are callable objects that contain a reference to the method. In this article, we will explore the necessary steps for passing a method as a parameter in Python.

## Step 1: Define the Method

The first step in passing a method as a parameter is to define the method. For example, let us consider the following method that takes in a list of integers and returns the sum of the even numbers in the list.

``` python
def sum_even_numbers(numbers: list[int]) -> int:
    sum = 0
    for num in numbers:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            sum += num
    return sum
```

## Step 2: Define the Function that Takes the Method as a Parameter

The next step is to define a function that will take the method as a parameter. In this example, let us consider the following function that calculates the sum of the even numbers in a list using the method that was defined earlier.

``` python
def calculate_sum(func, numbers: list[int]) -> int:
    return func(numbers)
```

## Step 3: Call the Function with the Method as a Parameter

The final step is to call the function that takes the method as a parameter. In this step, we pass the method as the first argument to the `calculate_sum` function.

``` python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
sum_of_evens = calculate_sum(sum_even_numbers, numbers)
print(sum_of_evens) # Output: 30
```

In this example, we have successfully passed the `sum_even_numbers` method as a parameter to the `calculate_sum` function.

## Conclusion

In summary, passing a method as a parameter in Python requires that we define the method, define a function that takes the method as a parameter, and then call the function with the method as an argument. The key concept to note is that we can pass both built-in methods, as well as user-defined methods, as parameters in Python.
