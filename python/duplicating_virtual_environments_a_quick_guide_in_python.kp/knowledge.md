## Introduction
Virtual environment is a useful tool in Python programming as it enables a developer to create an isolated environment for different projects, which means the package installed in one environment will not affect the packages in another environment. There are times when a developer needs to duplicate virtual environment, which might seem a difficult task, especially for beginners. In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps to duplicate virtual environment in Python.

## Requirements
Before we start duplicating virtual environment, you should have the following installed on your system:

- Python
- Pip
- Virtualenv (optional)
- Terminal or Command Prompt

## Steps to duplicate virtual environment
Follow the below steps to duplicate virtual environment in Python:

### Step 1 - Create a new environment
To create a new environment, run the following command:

```
$ virtualenv my_new_env
```

This will create a new environment named `my_new_env`.

### Step 2 - Activate the new environment
To activate the new environment, run the following command:

```
$ source my_new_env/bin/activate
```

This will activate the environment and change the prompt to reflect the new environment name.

### Step 3 - Install packages
Install the packages that are installed in the original environment by running the following command:

```
$ pip install -r /path/to/original/environment/requirements.txt
```

This will install all the packages from the original environment into the new environment.

### Step 4 - Deactivate the environment
To deactivate the new environment, run the following command:

```
$ deactivate
```

This will deactivate the environment and return the prompt to the original state.

## Conclusion
Duplicating virtual environment in Python is a straightforward process. By following the above steps, you can easily create a new environment and install the packages from the original environment to the new environment without affecting the original environment.
