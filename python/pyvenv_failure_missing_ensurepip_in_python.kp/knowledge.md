# Introduction 
When using Python, it's common to utilize tools like virtual environments to manage dependencies and ensure consistency across multiple projects. One of the recommended ways to create virtual environments is to use the `pyvenv` command. However, sometimes this command may not work, and one reason for this could be because `ensurepip` is not available in Python.

# What is ensurepip? 
`ensurepip` is a Python module that provides a way to automatically install and manage pip, a package manager for Python packages. It's included in many versions of Python by default.

# Why pyvenv depends on ensurepip?
`pyvenv` is a tool that's used to create virtual environments. During the creation of a virtual environment with `pyvenv`, by default, pip is installed using the `ensurepip` module. That way, the new virtual environment has its own pip that can be used to install packages specific to that environment.

# What to do if pyvenv is not working?
If `pyvenv` is not working because `ensurepip` is not available, there are a few options to consider. One is to try updating Python to a newer version that includes `ensurepip`, although this may not be feasible if the version is already the most recent. Another option is to manually install `pip` inside the virtual environment after creating it with `pyvenv`. This can be done by activating the virtual environment and then running `python -m ensurepip` followed by `python -m pip install --upgrade pip`. 

By following these steps, `pyvenv` should be able to create virtual environments without issue.
