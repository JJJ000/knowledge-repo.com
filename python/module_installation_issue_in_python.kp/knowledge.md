## Check the module installation

The first step to resolve the issue is to verify whether the module is installed or not. Python provides various ways to verify if the module is installed. Some common ways to check are:

- In the terminal or command prompt navigate to the Python environment and type `pip list`. It will show all the installed packages on that environment, so you can verify if the module is present or not.

- Try to install the module using `pip install <module_name>`. If the module is already installed, it will show `Requirement already satisfied`.

- Another way to test the installation is to open the Python shell and try to import the module. If the module is installed correctly, it should import successfully.


## Check the module path

In some cases, the path to the module may not be correctly specified, and Python is not able to find the module. Verify the module path to make sure it is correct.

- Check if the module path is in the PYTHONPATH environment variable. Python searches for modules in the directories specified in the PYTHONPATH environment variable.

- Modules can be installed in different directories or virtual environments, so it's essential to check if the module installation path is correct.

```python
import sys
print (sys.path)
```

This will print the directories Python searches for modules, verify if the module installation path is present in the list.


## Check for module conflicts

It's possible that there is a module conflict, and the installed module is not the expected one. Sometimes, a different version of the module is installed or a similarly named module. 

- Verify the module name is correct when importing. Typos in module name can also trigger import errors.
  
- It's best practice to use virtual environments when working on different Python projects. Verify that the correct virtual environment is activated or the correct Python version.


## Check for syntax errors or broken dependencies

Lastly, check for syntax errors or broken dependencies in the code you're trying to execute. Syntax errors or broken dependencies can prevent the module from importing or running correctly.

- Verify that the code has proper syntax.

- Check for dependencies that the module requires to function correctly.

- If you have made changes to the code, double-check there are no syntax errors or broken dependencies.

Once you have verified these steps, try importing the module again. If the issue persists, you may need to reinstall the module or contact support for further help.
