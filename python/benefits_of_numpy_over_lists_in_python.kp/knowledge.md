**Contents**

[TOC]

####Speed
NumPy is much faster than regular Python lists because of its use of pre-allocated memory blocks and optimized operations. This makes it ideal for performing complex numerical computations.

####Memory
NumPy arrays use less memory than Python lists. This is because NumPy stores data more compactly and allows for more efficient use of memory.

####Functionality
NumPy provides a wide range of powerful functions and operators that make it easy to manipulate and analyse data. It also provides a powerful array indexing system that allows for easy access to data elements.

####Support
NumPy has a large and active community of developers and users who are constantly working to improve the library and add new features. This makes it easy to find help and resources when needed.
