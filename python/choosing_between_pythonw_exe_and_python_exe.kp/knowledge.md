Pythonw.exe vs Python.exe

Introduction

Python is a programming language used for a wide range of applications. It has two key executable files, namely `pythonw.exe` and `python.exe`. Although they are both used for running Python code, they serve different purposes. This article will discuss the differences between the two.

Python.exe

Python.exe is a command-line tool that runs Python scripts. It is typically used to execute scripts in the Windows command prompt or the terminal in Linux or macOS. When a script is run using `python.exe`, the output is displayed in the console window. As such, it is suitable for scripts that need to interact with the user or scripts that require input from the console.

Pythonw.exe

Pythonw.exe is a version of Python that is specifically designed for running scripts with a graphical user interface (GUI). It is the preferred option for developers who wish to create standalone GUI applications using Python. This is because it does not display a console window, and the user interface is the primary window that opens when the application is run. Moreover, it enables the GUI to respond smoothly even when running long background tasks.

Differences

Here are the differences between `pythonw.exe` and `python.exe`:

1. Console Window

`python.exe` displays a console window when a script is executed. This is because it is meant for scripts that interact with the user using the command prompt or the terminal. On the other hand, `pythonw.exe` does not display a console window since it is intended for running GUI applications.

2. GUI Applications

`pythonw.exe` is the preferred option for running GUI applications created using Python. This is because it is designed to handle the graphical user interface rather than the console. `python.exe` can run GUI applications, but it displays a console window alongside the GUI interface when a script is executed.

3. Background Processes

`pythonw.exe` is better suited for running background tasks because it does not compete for system resources with the console window. This means that the GUI interface remains responsive even when running long or intensive background tasks. `python.exe` may cause the GUI interface to freeze or become unresponsive when running background tasks, depending on how the script is designed.

Conclusion

In summary, the choice between `pythonw.exe` and `python.exe` depends on the type of script you are running. If you are running a script that interacts with the user through the console, or if you need to see the output on the console, use `python.exe`. For GUI applications, use `pythonw.exe` as it provides a better user experience without the console window, and it is better suited for running background tasks that may consume a lot of resources.
