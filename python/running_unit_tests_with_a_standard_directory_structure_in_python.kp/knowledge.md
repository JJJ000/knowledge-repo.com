# Section 1 - Setting Up the Test Directory

The first step in running unittest with typical test directory structure in Python is to create a test directory. This test directory should contain all the necessary files and folders for the unittest framework to work properly. This includes a main.py file, which contains the main program, and a test directory, which contains the test files.

The main.py file should contain the code for the main program, as well as a main() function that will be called when the program is executed. The test directory should contain all the test files, which will contain the code for the tests. Each test file should have a name that reflects the test that it is running.

# Section 2 - Adding the Unittest Framework

The next step is to add the unittest framework to the project. This can be done by adding the unittest module to the main.py file. This module provides the necessary functions and classes for writing and running tests.

# Section 3 - Writing the Tests

Once the unittest framework has been added to the project, the next step is to write the tests. Each test should be written in a separate file in the test directory. Each test should have a name that reflects the test that it is running.

Each test should also contain a setUp() and tearDown() function. The setUp() function will be called before each test is run, and the tearDown() function will be called after each test is run. These functions can be used to set up and tear down any resources that are needed for the test.

# Section 4 - Running the Tests

Once the tests have been written, they can be run using the unittest framework. This can be done by running the main.py file, which will call the main() function. This main() function will then call the unittest.main() function, which will run all the tests in the test directory.

The results of the tests will be printed to the console. If any of the tests fail, then the test will be marked as failed and the details of the failure will be printed. If all the tests pass, then the test will be marked as passed and the details of the tests will be printed.
