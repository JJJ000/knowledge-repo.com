Introduction
---
Python is a popular high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. One of the most commonly used operators in Python is the *in* operator. The *in* operator is used to check if a value exists in a container, such as a list, tuple, or string. In this article, we will discuss the complexity of the *in* operator in Python.

Time complexity
---
The time complexity of the *in* operator depends on the container type. For lists, the *in* operator has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the list. This is because Python needs to iterate over every element in the list to check if the value is present.

For tuples and sets, the *in* operator has an average time complexity of O(1). This is because tuples are immutable and sets use a hash table to store elements, allowing for constant-time lookup.

For strings, the *in* operator has a time complexity of O(nm), where n is the length of the string and m is the length of the substring being searched for. This is because Python needs to search through the entire string to check if the substring is present.

Space complexity
---
The space complexity of the *in* operator is constant, as it does not require any additional memory to perform the operation.

Performance optimization
---
To optimize the performance of the *in* operator, it is recommended to use sets instead of lists when checking for the presence of a value. This is because sets have a constant-time lookup, while lists have a linear-time lookup.

Additionally, for large strings, it may be more efficient to use the *in* operator to check for the presence of individual characters rather than substrings. This is because checking for a single character has a time complexity of O(1), while checking for a substring has a time complexity of O(nm).
