# Section 1: Brute Force

The simplest way to list all primes below N in Python is to use a brute force approach. This involves looping through all numbers from 2 to N and testing each one for primality. If a number is found to be prime, it is added to a list of primes.

# Section 2: Sieve of Eratosthenes

Another way to list all primes below N in Python is to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This is an ancient algorithm that uses a simple, yet efficient, approach to identify prime numbers. The algorithm works by creating a list of all numbers from 2 to N and then looping through each number and marking its multiples as non-prime. At the end of the loop, the remaining numbers in the list are all prime numbers.

# Section 3: Prime Number Generator

Python also has a built-in function, called `itertools.islice`, which can be used to generate prime numbers. This function takes two arguments: a generator function and a limit. The generator function is used to generate a sequence of numbers and the limit is used to specify the maximum number in the sequence. The `itertools.islice` function then iterates through the sequence and returns only the prime numbers.

# Section 4: Pre-computed List

Finally, if the list of primes below N is not too large, it may be possible to pre-compute the list and store it in a file. This approach is more efficient than the other methods because it does not require any computation. The list can simply be loaded from the file and used directly.
