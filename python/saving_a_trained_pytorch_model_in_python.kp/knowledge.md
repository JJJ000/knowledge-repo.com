## Step 1: Create a Checkpoint Object

The first step in saving a trained model in PyTorch is to create a checkpoint object. This object will be used to store the model's weights and other parameters. To create a checkpoint object, use the `torch.save()` method.

## Step 2: Save the State Dictionary

The next step is to save the state dictionary of the model. The state dictionary contains the model's weights, biases, and other parameters. To save the state dictionary, use the `torch.save()` method.

## Step 3: Save the Model

The last step is to save the model itself. To save the model, use the `torch.save()` method.

## Step 4: Load the Model

Finally, to load the model, use the `torch.load()` method. This will load the saved model and its weights, biases, and other parameters.
