##Yes
Python lists are guaranteed to keep their elements in the order they are inserted in. This is because lists are ordered collections, meaning that the order of the elements is maintained.

##How
When an element is added to a list, it is stored at the end of the list. This ensures that the order of the elements is maintained, as each element is added to the end of the list.

##Why
The order of the elements in a list is important for many applications. For example, when iterating over a list, it is important to know the order of the elements so that the correct elements are processed in the correct order. Keeping the elements in the order they are inserted in ensures that the list can be used correctly.

##Example
For example, if a list contains the elements [1, 2, 3], the list will always remain in that order. If a fourth element, 4, is added to the list, it will be added to the end of the list, resulting in the list [1, 2, 3, 4].
