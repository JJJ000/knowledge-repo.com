tldr: pip does not always check for the latest version of a package, so it may use an outdated version from its cache.

# Section 1: Understanding the Issue

The issue of pip using incorrect cached package versions instead of the user-specified version in Python can arise when pip is used to install packages. This is because pip caches packages in order to improve the speed of package installations. When a package is installed, pip will save a copy of the package in its cache and use this cached version instead of the user-specified version when installing the package again. This can lead to unexpected results, as the cached version may be different from the user-specified version.

# Section 2: Causes of the Issue

The main cause of this issue is that pip caches packages in order to improve the speed of package installations. When a package is installed, pip will save a copy of the package in its cache and use this cached version instead of the user-specified version when installing the package again. This can lead to unexpected results, as the cached version may be different from the user-specified version.

# Section 3: Solutions

The best way to avoid this issue is to always specify the exact version of the package that you want to install. This can be done by using the --no-cache-dir flag when installing a package. This flag will prevent pip from caching the package and will ensure that the user-specified version is always used.

Another solution is to clear the pip cache regularly. This can be done by running the command “pip cache clean”. This will delete all of the packages in the pip cache, ensuring that the user-specified version is always used.

# Section 4: Conclusion 

In conclusion, the issue of pip using incorrect cached package versions instead of the user-specified version in Python can be avoided by always specifying the exact version of the package that you want to install and by regularly clearing the pip cache. This will ensure that the user-specified version is always used, avoiding any unexpected results.
