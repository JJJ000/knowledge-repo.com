tldr: Use the timedelta function in the datetime module to calculate the difference between two datetime objects and then access the total seconds attribute.

## Section 1: Convert dates to datetime objects
To calculate the difference between two dates in Python, we first need to convert the dates into datetime objects. This can be done using the `datetime` module in Python.


## Section 2: Calculate the difference between two datetimes
Once we have converted both dates into datetime objects, we can simply subtract one from the other to get the time difference between the two dates. This will give us a timedelta object that represents the time difference in days, seconds, and microseconds.


## Section 3: Convert timedelta object to seconds
To get the time difference in seconds, we can simply use the `total_seconds()` method of the timedelta object that we obtained in the previous step.


## Section 4: Putting it all together
Here is a code snippet that demonstrates how to calculate the difference, in seconds, between two dates in Python:

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Define two dates
date_1 = "2022-01-01"
date_2 = "2022-01-05"

# Convert dates to datetime objects
datetime_1 = datetime.strptime(date_1, "%Y-%m-%d")
datetime_2 = datetime.strptime(date_2, "%Y-%m-%d")

# Calculate time difference between two datetimes
timedelta = datetime_2 - datetime_1

# Convert timedelta object to seconds
time_diff_seconds = timedelta.total_seconds()

print("Time difference in seconds:", time_diff_seconds)
```

This will output:

```
Time difference in seconds: 345600.0
```

Which means the two dates are 345600 seconds apart (or 4 days apart).
