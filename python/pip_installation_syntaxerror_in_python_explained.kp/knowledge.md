Section 1: Introduction
Python is an open-source software that is easy to learn and has a vast library of packages. One of its tools for managing packages is pip, which helps in the installation and management of external packages. However, sometimes users may encounter errors such as SyntaxError when trying to use pip inside Python.

Section 2: Possible Causes of SyntaxError
SyntaxError is a common error encountered when trying to install pip packages. Some possible causes of this error are:

1. Incorrect Syntax: If the user types the pip install command with incorrect syntax, Python will raise a SyntaxError. For example, if the user enters "pip intall" instead of "pip install," Python will throw a SyntaxError.

2. Incompatible packages: The SyntaxError might come up because the installation of the package is not compatible with the Python version the user is running. 

Section 3: Ways to Resolve SyntaxError
There are some ways to resolve the issue of SyntaxError when using pip install in Python. Here are some recommended solutions:

1. Proper Syntax: Users must ensure they type the right syntax for pip install. Running "pip install <package_name>" is the right way to install a package. 

2. Compatibility Check: The user should check if the package they want to install is compatible with their Python version. If the package is not compatible, users should either update their Python version or search for another package that's compatible with their current Python version.

3. Reinstallation of Python: If the above solutions do not work, users can consider reinstalling Python. This solution is usually recommended when there is a more significant issue with the Python setup or when other attempts to fix the syntax error fail.

Section 4: Conclusion
In summary, SyntaxError when using pip install in Python can be caused by incorrect syntax or incompatible packages. Users can fix the issue by ensuring they use the right syntax or by checking the compatibility of the package with their Python version. Reinstalling Python is also an option when other attempts to resolve the issue fail.
