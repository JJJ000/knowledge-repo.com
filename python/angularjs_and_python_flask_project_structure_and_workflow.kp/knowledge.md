## AngularJS Workflow Overview

AngularJS is a JavaScript framework that simplifies the development of dynamic web applications. The typical AngularJS workflow involves several steps, including creating a project structure, defining the application module, creating controllers and views, and routing between views. The project structure for an AngularJS application typically consists of several directories and files, including a main HTML file, JavaScript files for the application module and controllers, and HTML files for each view.

## Project Structure

To build a typical AngularJS project with Python Flask, you first need to set up a basic Flask application with a project structure that is compatible with AngularJS. This generally involves creating directories for static files, templates, and configuration files, as well as creating a main application file that defines routes and initializes the Flask application.

```text
app/
    routes.py
    static/
        css/
        js/
        lib/
        img/
    templates/
        index.html
        partials/
            home.html
            about.html
            contact.html
    __init__.py
```

In this structure, `routes.py` defines the routes for the Flask application and the `static` directory contains all the static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and image files. `index.html` is the main HTML file for the project and includes the application module, which is defined in `app.js`. `partials` contains HTML files for each view, including `home.html`, `about.html`, and `contact.html`. Finally, `__init__.py` initializes the Flask application.

## Building the AngularJS App

Once you have set up the Flask project structure, the next step is to build the AngularJS app. This involves defining the application module and controllers, creating views for each controller, and defining routes between the views.

```javascript
var app = angular.module('myApp', ['ngRoute']);

app.config(function($routeProvider) {
  $routeProvider
    .when('/home', {
      templateUrl: 'partials/home.html',
      controller: 'HomeController'
    })
    .when('/about', {
      templateUrl: 'partials/about.html',
      controller: 'AboutController'
    })
    .when('/contact', {
      templateUrl: 'partials/contact.html',
      controller: 'ContactController'
    })
    .otherwise({redirectTo: '/home'});
});

app.controller('HomeController', function($scope) {
  $scope.message = 'Welcome to the home page!';
});

app.controller('AboutController', function($scope) {
  $scope.message = 'Learn more about us on this page.';
});

app.controller('ContactController', function($scope) {
  $scope.message = 'Contact us on this page.';
});
```

In this example, we define the `myApp` module and include the `ngRoute` module to handle routing between views. We then define the routes and corresponding controllers using the `$routeProvider` service. Finally, we define the controllers themselves and add content to each. 

## Running the App

To run the completed AngularJS application with Python Flask, you need to start the Flask webserver and navigate to the relevant URL in your browser. To do this, you just run the `routes.py` file in your Flask app directory and visit the relevant URL (e.g. `http://localhost:5000/home`). The AngularJS application will then load and display the relevant view, based on the current URL route.
