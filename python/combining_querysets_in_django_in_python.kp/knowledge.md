[TOC]

# Section 1: Using the Union Operator
The Django ORM provides a union() method that allows you to combine two querysets into a single queryset. To use this method, you must have two querysets of the same type, and they must have the same fields.

# Section 2: Using the Chain Method
The chain() method allows you to combine multiple querysets into a single queryset, regardless of their type. This method does not require that the querysets have the same fields.

# Section 3: Using the Union All Method
The union_all() method is similar to the union() method, but it does not eliminate duplicate rows. This method can be used to combine two querysets of the same type and with the same fields.

# Section 4: Using the Concat Method
The concat() method allows you to combine multiple querysets into a single queryset, regardless of their type. This method does not require that the querysets have the same fields. It also does not eliminate duplicate rows.
