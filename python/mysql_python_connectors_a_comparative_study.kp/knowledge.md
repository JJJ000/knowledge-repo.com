tldr: MySQLdb and mysqlclient are both Python libraries that allow Python programs to communicate with a MySQL database, while MySQL Connector/Python is an official MySQL driver for Python that supports standard Python Database API.

## MySQLdb

MySQLdb is a Python interface for the MySQL database. It is a third-party library that provides a connection between Python and MySQL database server. MySQLdb has been around since the early days of Python and is currently no longer maintained. However, it is still popular among Python developers and used in some projects as it has a stable and reliable performance.


## mysqlclient

mysqlclient is a fork of MySQLdb that is compatible with Python 2 and 3 versions. Its goal is to improve the overall performance and stability of MySQLdb. The library is compatible with both MySQL and MariaDB databases. It provides an API similar to MySQLdb so programs written with MySQLdb can easily switch to using mysqlclient. mysqlclient is currently actively maintained.


## MySQL Connector/Python

MySQL Connector/Python is a pure Python implementation library for the MySQL protocol. It is an official MySQL driver that is provided by Oracle for Python, which means it is supported and maintained by Oracle. It supports both Python 2 and 3 versions and provides a modern, Pythonic API that is compatible with other major database APIs such as SQLAlchemy. MySQL Connector/Python supports both MySQL and MariaDB databases, and it is actively maintained with new features and updates.


## Conclusion

In summary, MySQLdb and mysqlclient are third-party libraries that provide a Python interface for MySQL database server. mysqlclient is a fork of MySQLdb and provides better performance and stability. On the other hand, MySQL Connector/Python is an official MySQL driver that is provided by Oracle and provides a modern, Pythonic API. MySQL Connector/Python is more actively maintained and updated with new features. While you can use any of these libraries to connect Python to MySQL, the choice between them will depend on the specific requirements of your project.
