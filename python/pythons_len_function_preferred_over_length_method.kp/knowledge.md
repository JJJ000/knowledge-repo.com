tldr: Python code uses len() function instead of a length method because Python prioritizes simplicity and consistency in its syntax, and using a function allows for a simpler and more consistent coding experience.

[TOC]

There are several reasons why Python code uses the `len()` function instead of a length method. 

## 1. Compatibility

One reason for this is compatibility with other programming languages. The `len()` function is a built-in function in many programming languages, including C, Java, and Perl. Using the same function in Python makes it easier for developers who are familiar with other languages to transition to Python.

## 2. Generalization

Another reason is that the `len()` function is a more general solution that can be used with any object that has a length property. This includes many built-in Python data types, such as lists, tuples, and strings, as well as user-defined objects that define a `__len__()` method.

## 3. Simplicity

Using the `len()` function can also make code simpler and more concise. Instead of having to remember and use different methods for different data types, developers can use a single function to get the length of any object.

## 4. Consistency

Finally, using the `len()` function provides consistency within the Python language itself. By using a consistent naming scheme for built-in functions, Python makes it easier for developers to learn and use the language. This consistency helps to reduce confusion and makes it easier to write and maintain code.
