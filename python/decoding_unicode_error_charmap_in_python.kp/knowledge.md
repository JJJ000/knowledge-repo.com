# Overview
A `UnicodeDecodeError` is an error that occurs when Python is trying to decode a string of text and the character encoding specified is not supported. This error typically occurs when the character encoding used is not supported by the system, or when the encoding used is not the same as the one used to encode the text.

# Causes
The most common cause of a `UnicodeDecodeError` is when the character encoding used to encode the text is not supported by the system. This can occur when the text is encoded with a character encoding that is not supported by the system, or when the encoding used is not the same as the one used to encode the text.

# Resolution
The best way to resolve a `UnicodeDecodeError` is to use a supported character encoding. The most common character encodings are UTF-8, UTF-16, and ASCII. If the text is encoded with a character encoding that is not supported by the system, it is possible to convert the text to a supported encoding using a text editor or other software.

# Prevention
In order to prevent a `UnicodeDecodeError`, it is important to ensure that the character encoding used to encode the text is supported by the system. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the encoding used is the same as the one used to encode the text. This can be done by ensuring that the text is encoded using a supported character encoding before it is sent to the system.
