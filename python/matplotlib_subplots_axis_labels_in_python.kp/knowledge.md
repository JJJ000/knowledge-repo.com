tldr: It depends on the data being plotted, but commonly used label names are `x-axis label` and `y-axis label`.

Introduction

When creating multiple subplots with matplotlib in Python, it is important to have clear and concise xlabels and ylabels that accurately describe the data being displayed. This not only enhances the readability of the plots, but also makes it easier to interpret and analyze the data. In this article, we will discuss some common xlabels and ylabels for matplotlib subplots in Python.

Common xlabel and ylabel for matplotlib subplots

Section 1: Time

When plotting time series data, the xlabel can be set to "Time" or "Date" depending on the format of the data. The ylabel can be set to the variable being measured, such as "Temperature (°C)" or "Stock Price (USD)".

Section 2: Frequency

When plotting frequency data, the xlabel can be set to "Frequency" or "Wavelength". The ylabel can be set to the variable being measured, such as "Amplitude" or "Intensity".

Section 3: Scatter plots

When plotting scatter plots, the xlabel can be set to the independent variable being measured, while the ylabel can be set to the dependent variable being measured. For instance, if you are plotting the relationship between age and height, the xlabel can be set to "Age" and the ylabel can be set to "Height".

Section 4: Histograms

When plotting histograms, the xlabel can be set to the variable being measured, such as "Temperature (°C)" or "Stock Price (USD)". The ylabel can be set to the frequency of occurrence, such as "Number of Occurrences" or "Density".

Conclusion

In conclusion, the xlabels and ylabels of subplots in matplotlib play an important role in determining the readability and interpretability of the data. It is important to choose labels that accurately describe the data being presented, and are concise and clear. By using the appropriate xlabels and ylabels, the data can be better analyzed and interpreted, leading to more effective decision making.
