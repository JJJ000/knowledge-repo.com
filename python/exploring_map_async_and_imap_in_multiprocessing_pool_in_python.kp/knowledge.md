tldr: map\_async returns results in an order that may not correspond to the order of inputs while imap returns results in the same order as the inputs.

## Introduction

`multiprocessing.Pool` is a module in Python that provides a way to parallelize CPU-bound tasks by using multiple processes. Two of the methods in `multiprocessing.Pool` are `map_async` and `imap`. Both of them map a function to the elements of an iterable, and they return an iterator that produces the results in the same order as the iterable. However, they have some differences regarding how they process the iterable and how they return the results. 

## Map_async
`map_async` applies a given function to the elements of an iterable asynchronously, that is, it starts all the processes in the pool and distributes the elements of the iterable among them. It then returns a `multiprocessing.pool.AsyncResult` object, which can be used to retrieve the results of the computation. The `AsyncResult` object has a `get` method that blocks until all the processes have finished and returns a list with the results in the order of the original iterable. `map_async` can be useful when:

- The function takes a long time to execute, and you want to start retrieving the results before it finishes.
- The iterable is very large, and you don't want to load it entirely into memory at once.

## Imap
`imap` applies a given function to the elements of an iterable lazily, that is, it returns an iterator that produces the results one by one as they are computed by the pool. This means that you can start processing the elements of the iterable immediately, without waiting for the entire iterable to be loaded into memory or for the first result to be computed. The `imap` method returns an iterator that you can loop over to get the results in the order of the original iterable. `imap` can be useful when:

- You want to process large iterables, but you don't want to load them entirely into memory at once.
- You want to start processing the elements of the iterable immediately, without waiting for the entire iterable to be loaded into memory or for the first result to be computed.

## Comparison
The difference between `map_async` and `imap` can be summarized as follows:

- `map_async` applies the function to the elements of the iterable asynchronously and returns an `AsyncResult` object that can be used to retrieve the results in the original order.
- `imap` applies the function to the elements of the iterable lazily and returns an iterator that produces the results in the original order as they are computed.
- `map_async` can be useful when you want to start retrieving the results before the function finishes or when you have a very large iterable.
- `imap` can be useful when you want to start processing the iterable immediately or when you have a very large iterable.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, both `map_async` and `imap` are useful methods in `multiprocessing.Pool` that allow you to parallelize CPU-bound tasks by using multiple processes. They have some differences regarding how they process the iterable and how they return the results, but both of them are useful in different situations. `map_async` is asynchronous and returns an `AsyncResult` object that can be used to retrieve the results in the original order, while `imap` is lazy and returns an iterator that produces the results in the original order as they are computed.
