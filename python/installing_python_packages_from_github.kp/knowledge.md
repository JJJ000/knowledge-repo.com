## Download

The first step to installing a Python package from GitHub is to download the package. You can do this by clicking the green "Clone or download" button on the main page of the package's repository. This will give you the option to either clone the repository using Git or to download it as a ZIP file.

## Unzip

Once the package has been downloaded, you will need to unzip it. If you downloaded the package as a ZIP file, you can do this by simply double-clicking the ZIP file, which will open it and extract its contents.

## Install

Once the package has been extracted, you can install it using the command line. To do this, open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where the package is located. Then, run the command `pip install .` to install the package.

## Test

Once the package has been installed, you can test it by running a few commands in the Python interpreter. You can do this by launching the Python interpreter and running a few commands related to the package. If everything works as expected, then the package has been successfully installed.
