tldr: A list comprehension can be used to iterate through a nested list to process each item in the list.

**Contents**

[TOC]

**Section 1: Creating a Nested List**

A nested list is a list that contains other lists as elements. To create a nested list in Python, use brackets to enclose each sublist. 

For example, the following code creates a nested list of three sublists: 

```
my_list = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]]
```

**Section 2: Using List Comprehensions**

List comprehensions are a powerful way to process nested lists in Python. They allow you to quickly and easily create a new list based on the contents of an existing list. 

For example, the following code uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing the squares of the numbers in the nested list: 

```
squares = [x**2 for x in my_list]
```

**Section 3: Nested List Comprehensions**

Nested list comprehensions can be used to process nested lists in Python. They allow you to create a new list based on the contents of a nested list. 

For example, the following code uses a nested list comprehension to create a new list containing the sum of the numbers in each sublist of the nested list: 

```
sums = [sum(x) for x in my_list]
```

**Section 4: Additional Resources**
