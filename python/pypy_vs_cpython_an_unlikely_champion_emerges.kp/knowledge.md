tldr: PyPy has a Just-in-Time (JIT) compiler which allows it to execute Python code faster than CPythonâ€™s interpreted approach.

[TOC]

Section 1: JIT Compilation
One of the primary reasons that PyPy can beat CPython is that it incorporates a just-in-time (JIT) compiler. CPython is an interpreter that executes Python code line-by-line, while PyPy includes a JIT compiler that can optimize the execution of Python code on the fly. This means that PyPy can dynamically compile performance-critical sections of Python code to native machine code, providing a significant performance boost over traditional interpreted execution.

Section 2: Garbage Collection
Another advantage of PyPy is its garbage collection implementation. Unlike CPython, which uses a reference counting method for garbage collection, PyPy uses a generational garbage collector that is more efficient and can handle large-scale memory management tasks more effectively. This allows PyPy to handle larger, more complex applications without running into performance issues caused by memory constraints.

Section 3: Compatibility
PyPy is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.6 dialects of the language, meaning that it can execute code written in those dialects without issues. Due to this, PyPy can handle most Python codebases with ease, making it easy to switch from CPython to PyPy with minimal changes to existing code.

Section 4: Open Source Support
PyPy is also supported by an active community of developers and contributors, who work together to maintain and improve the project. This ensures that PyPy is constantly being updated and optimized, with new features and performance improvements being added regularly. Additionally, being open source ensures that users can leverage the power of the community to find solutions to any problems that may arise.
