Section 1: Introduction
In programming, there are instances when we want to limit the range of a number to a specific range. For example, suppose we have a program that keeps track of the temperature of an oven, and the temperature range of the oven is between 0°C and 100°C. In that case, we would want to restrict the temperature readings to this range to prevent the oven from overheating or cooling down too much. In Python, there are different ways to clamp (clip, restrict) a number to a specific range, as discussed in the following sections.

Section 2: Using the min() and max() functions
One simple way to clip a number to a specific range is to use the min() and max() functions. The min() function returns the minimum value of a set of numbers, while the max() function returns the maximum value of a set of numbers. We can use these functions to restrict a number to a specific range by taking the maximum of the minimum value and the minimum of the maximum value.

For example, to limit a number x to a range between a and b, we can use the following code:

```python
x = max(a, min(x, b))
```

In this code, we take the minimum of x and b to ensure that x is not greater than b, then take the maximum of this value and a to ensure that x is not less than a.

Section 3: Using the clip() function
Python also provides a built-in function called clip() that we can use to clamp values to a specific range. The clip() function takes two arguments: a minimum value and a maximum value. If a value is less than the minimum value, it is set to the minimum value. If a value is greater than the maximum value, it is set to the maximum value.

For example, to clamp a number x to a range between a and b using clip(), we can use the following code:

```python
x = clip(x, a, b)
```

Section 4: Using conditional statements
Another way to limit a number to a specific range is to use conditional statements. We can write an if statement to test if a number is less than the lower bound or greater than the upper bound, and then set the number to the appropriate bound if it fails the test.

For example, to clip a number x to a range between a and b using conditional statements, we can use the following code:

```python
if x < a:
    x = a
elif x > b:
    x = b
``` 

In this code, we test if x is less than a, and if it is, we set x to a. If x is greater than b, we set x to b. If neither of these conditions is true, x remains unchanged.
