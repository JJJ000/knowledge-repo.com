tldr: A colorbar in matplotlib is a visualization tool that provides a map of colors to values and its text labels can be added using the `set\_ticklabels()` function.

1. Introduction to Colorbars in Matplotlib

In data visualization, color mapping plays a significant role to understand the data easily. Colorbars are graphical representations of the color mapping that MATLAB uses in your data visualizations. Matplotlib allows us to create colorbars, which are very helpful to understand the data easily. They are also useful in helping convey information about the intensity and range of values displayed in the visualization. In Matplotlib, we can customize colorbars as per our requirement.

2. Creating Colorbars in Matplotlib

Matplotlib provides various functions to create colorbars. Some of the commonly used functions are:

* colorbar()
* ScalarMappable()
* ListedColormap()

We can use the 'colorbar()' function for creating a colorbar. It automatically takes care of the color mapping and creates a bar with colors that represent different values.

For example,

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

data = np.random.rand(10, 10) * 20

plt.imshow(data)
plt.colorbar()
plt.show()
```

The above code creates a colorbar for the data that has been visualized in the imshow plot.

3. Customizing Colorbars in Matplotlib

Matplotlib provides us with many ways to customize the colorbars. Some of the commonly used properties are:

* set_label()
* set_ticks()
* set_ticklabels()
* set_cmap()

These functions can be called on the colorbar object created using the 'colorbar()' function.

For example,

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

data = np.random.rand(10, 10) * 20

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
image = ax.imshow(data)
cbar = fig.colorbar(image)
cbar.set_label('Intensity')
cbar.set_ticks([0, 5, 10, 15, 20])
cbar.set_ticklabels(['Low', 'Medium', 'High'])
plt.show()
```

The above code will create a colorbar with a label named 'Intensity' and customized tick labels.

4. Adding Text Labels to Colorbars in Matplotlib

We can also add text labels to the colorbars in Matplotlib. To do that, we need to use the 'ax.text()' function to create the text and then set the position of the text using the 'transform' property.

For example,

```
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

data = np.random.rand(10, 10) * 20

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
image = ax.imshow(data)
cbar = fig.colorbar(image)
ax.text(-0.1, 1.02, 'Data Intensity', transform=ax.transAxes)
plt.show()
```

The above code will create a colorbar with a label named 'Data Intensity' positioned on the top of the colorbar. The position of the label is set using the 'transform' property.
