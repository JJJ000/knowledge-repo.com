tldr: The `beyond top level package` error occurs when attempting to import a module from a package that is not located in the same directory as the current package.

# Explanation

Relative imports allow a module to reference other modules relative to its own location. This is useful for organizing code into packages, and for avoiding name clashes between modules in different packages. However, when attempting to import a module from beyond the top-level package, a "beyond top-level package error" may occur.

# Causes

The most common cause of this error is when a module is attempting to access a module that is located outside of the top-level package. This is not allowed in Python, as the relative import syntax assumes that the module is within the same package. 

# Solutions

The simplest solution is to use an absolute import instead of a relative import. This will allow the module to access modules outside of the top-level package.

Another solution is to reorganize the code into packages so that the module is within the top-level package. This may require restructuring the code and may not be feasible in all cases.
