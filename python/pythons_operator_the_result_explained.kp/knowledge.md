## Modulo Operator

The `%` symbol in Python is known as the modulo operator. The modulo operator performs the division operation and returns the remainder. 

For example, `7 % 3` will return `1` because when you divide `7` by `3`, the remainder is `1`. 

## Example Usage

```python
x = 10 
y = 3 

result = x % y 

print(result) # Output: 1 
```

In this example, we declared two variables `x` and `y` and assigned them the values of 10 and 3 respectively. 

Afterwards, we used the modulo operator to perform the division operation and return the remainder. The value of `result` would be `1` since `10` divided by `3` gives us a remainder of `1`. 

## Conclusion

The `%` symbol in Python is a common operator used to return the remainder from a division operation. It is very useful in programming and can be used in many different scenarios.
