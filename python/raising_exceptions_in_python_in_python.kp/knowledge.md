### Syntax

The syntax for raising an exception in Python is as follows:

`raise ExceptionName(args)`

Where `ExceptionName` is the type of exception to be raised and `args` is a list of arguments associated with the exception.

### Example

For example, to raise a `ValueError` exception with the message "Invalid value" you would use the following syntax:

`raise ValueError("Invalid value")`

### Catching Exceptions

When an exception is raised, it can be caught and handled using a `try`/`except` block. For example:

```python
try:
    # Some code here
    raise ValueError("Invalid value")
except ValueError as e:
    # Handle the exception here
    print("Caught ValueError:", e)
```

### Best Practices

When raising exceptions, it is best practice to use meaningful error messages that describe the issue clearly. This will help in debugging and make it easier to handle exceptions in the `except` block.
