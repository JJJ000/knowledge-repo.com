# Overview 
JSONDecodeError is an error that occurs when a JSON document fails to be parsed correctly. It is a type of ValueError, which is raised when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the right type but an inappropriate value.

# Causes
JSONDecodeError is raised when there is an unexpected character, such as a comma, at the beginning of the JSON document. It can also be raised if the document is not properly formatted, such as if there are missing or extra characters.

# Resolution
The best way to resolve a JSONDecodeError is to ensure that the document is properly formatted and that all of the necessary characters are present. If the document is not properly formatted, it can be manually edited to correct any errors. Additionally, some JSON parsers provide tools to help with debugging and resolving JSONDecodeErrors. 

# Prevention
The best way to prevent a JSONDecodeError is to ensure that the JSON document is properly formatted before attempting to parse it. Additionally, it is important to use a JSON parser that is compatible with the version of JSON being used.
