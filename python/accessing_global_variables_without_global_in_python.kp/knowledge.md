# Advantages of Python
Python is a high-level programming language that offers a number of advantages over other languages. One of these advantages is that Python does not require the use of the 'global' keyword to access global variables.

# Global Variables
In Python, global variables are variables that are accessible from all parts of the program. They are declared outside of any function or class and can be used in any part of the code.

# Scope of Variables
In Python, variables have a scope, which determines the part of the program in which they can be used. Variables declared outside of any function or class have a global scope, which means they can be used anywhere in the program.

# No Need for 'global' Keyword
Because global variables have a global scope, there is no need to use the 'global' keyword to access them. This makes accessing global variables simpler and more intuitive in Python than in other languages.
