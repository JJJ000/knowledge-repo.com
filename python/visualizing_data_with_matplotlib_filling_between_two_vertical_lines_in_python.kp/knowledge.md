tldr: Use the `fill\_betweenx()` function from the matplotlib module, specifying the values for the x and y coordinates of the vertical lines and define the range to fill between the lines.

Section 1: Introduction

Matplotlib is one of the most widely used Python libraries for data visualization. It offers a range of plot types, such as line plots, scatterplots, bar charts, and more. One common requirement in data visualization is to fill between two vertical lines in a plot. This can be useful in plotting a range of values, showing confidence intervals, or highlighting specific regions of a plot. However, the process may not be immediately obvious to beginners, so this tutorial will walk through the steps needed to fill between two vertical lines in matplotlib.

Section 2: Creating a Simple Plot

To start, let's create a simple plot with two vertical lines using matplotlib. We'll use the numpy library to create some sample data:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 10, 100)
y = x**2

# plot the data
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y)

# add vertical lines
ax.axvline(x=2, color='red')
ax.axvline(x=8, color='red')
```

This code generates a plot with a parabola as the main data and two vertical lines at x=2 and x=8 in the color red.

Section 3: Filling Between the Lines

Now that we have our plot and vertical lines, let's fill the area between the lines. We can do this using the `fill_between` function in matplotlib. Here's the code to fill between the lines:

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y)

# add vertical lines
ax.axvline(x=2, color='red')
ax.axvline(x=8, color='red')

# fill between the lines
ax.fill_between(x, y, where=((x > 2) & (x < 8)), alpha=0.2)
```

In this code, we added a call to `fill_between` after adding the vertical lines. This function takes three arguments: the x-values, the y-values, and a boolean array specifying where the fill should occur. In this case, we set the `where` parameter to `((x > 2) & (x < 8))`, which is a boolean array that is `True` where `x` is between 2 and 8. We also set the alpha parameter to `0.2` to make the fill somewhat transparent.

Section 4: Conclusion

That's it! You now know how to fill between two vertical lines in matplotlib. This technique can be very useful in certain types of data visualizations, and it's easy to customize the fill color or transparency if desired. With this knowledge, you should be able to create a variety of visualizations in Python using matplotlib.
