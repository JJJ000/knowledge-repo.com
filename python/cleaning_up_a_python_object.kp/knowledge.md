1. __Garbage Collection__ 
Garbage collection is the process of reclaiming memory from objects that are no longer being used. It is done automatically in Python, so there is no need to explicitly clean up objects.

2. __Explicit Deletion__
When the object is no longer needed, it can be explicitly deleted using the `del` keyword. This will remove the object from memory and can help to prevent memory leaks.

3. __Reference Counting__
In Python, objects are managed using reference counting. When an object is no longer referenced, its reference count is decremented and the object is eventually cleaned up by the garbage collector.

4. __Weak References__ 
In some cases, it may be necessary to keep a reference to an object without preventing it from being cleaned up by the garbage collector. This can be done using weak references, which allow an object to be referenced without increasing its reference count.
