tldr: Python does not support multiline lambdas because it is not necessary for the concise expression of a function in a single line.

#### Limitations of Lambda

Python's lambda expression is a single line expression and does not support multiline expressions. This is due to the fact that lambda expressions are designed to be a concise way to define a function in Python. 

#### Benefits of Lambda

The primary benefit of using lambda expressions is that it allows for the creation of functions without the need for a full function definition. This makes it possible to create functions quickly and easily without having to write out the full function definition. This makes lambda expressions ideal for situations where a quick and concise solution is needed.

#### Alternatives to Multiline Lambda

Although multiline lambda expressions are not supported in Python, there are alternatives that can be used to achieve the same result. For example, the use of a regular function definition or a nested lambda expression can be used to create a multiline expression.

#### Conclusion

In conclusion, Python does not support multiline lambda expressions due to the limitations of lambda expressions. However, there are alternatives that can be used to achieve the same result.
