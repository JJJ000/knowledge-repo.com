tldr: To read the RGB value of a given pixel in Python, we can use the `getpixel()` method from the `PIL` module.

## Importing Libraries

First, we need to import the necessary library to read the RGB value of a given pixel. The most commonly used library for working with images in Python is the PIL, also known as the Pillow library. To import this library, we will use the following command:

```python
from PIL import Image
```


## Opening Image and Accessing Pixel Values

Once we have imported the relevant library, the next step is to open the image we want to read pixels from. We can create an image object using the Image.open() function from the Pillow library. This function takes the file path of the image as the argument. After opening the image, we can use the load() function to get the pixel values. 

```python
img = Image.open('image.jpg')
pixel_values = img.load()
```


## Reading RGB Value of Given Pixel

Now that we have loaded the image and obtained the pixel values, we can read the RGB value of any given pixel. To get the RGB value of a particular pixel, we can simply use the getpixel() function from the image object, which takes the (x,y) coordinates of the pixel as arguments.

```python
r, g, b = img.getpixel((x, y))
```


## Final Code

Here is what the final code to read the RGB value of a given pixel in Python looks like:

```python
from PIL import Image

img = Image.open('image.jpg')
pixel_values = img.load()

# example of reading the RGB value of pixel at (100, 100)
x = 100
y = 100
r, g, b = img.getpixel((x, y))
print(f"RGB value at pixel ({x}, {y}): ({r}, {g}, {b})")
```
