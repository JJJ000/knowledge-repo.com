## Section 1: Understanding environment variables

Environment variables are defined as key-value pairs that are assigned to dynamic values that can affect the behavior of a system, a program, or a process. These variables serve as placeholders for certain system-related or user-related values, and they are accessed by applications or programs running on the system.

In Python or any other programming language, environment variables can be accessed and set using built-in libraries or modules. Setting environment variables is necessary while working on various projects, especially when you are working with APIs, or when you need to interact with databases requiring authentication.

## Section 2: Setting environment variables in PyCharm

PyCharm is a popular integrated development environment (IDE) for Python, and it provides an easy way to set environment variables for the current project.

To set environment variables in PyCharm:

1. Open your PyCharm project and navigate to `Run` -> `Edit Configurations`.
2. In the `Configuration` tab, look for the `Environment variables` option under `Environment`.
3. Click on the `...` button next to the `Environment variables` option to open the `Environment Variables` dialog box.
4. In the `Environment Variables` dialog box, click on the `+` button to add a new environment variable. 
5. Enter the name and value of the environment variable in the `Name` and `Value` fields, respectively. 
6. Click on `OK` to save the environment variable. 

## Section 3: Accessing environment variables in Python

Once you have set environment variables in PyCharm, you can access them in your Python code using the `os` module. 

Here's an example of how to access environment variables in Python:

```python
import os

# Get the value of an environment variable
secret_key = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')

# Set the value of an environment variable
os.environ['SECRET_KEY'] = 'my_secret_key'
```

In this example, the `os.environ.get()` function is used to get the value of the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable. The `os.environ` dictionary is used to set the `SECRET_KEY` environment variable to the value `'my_secret_key'`.

Note that any environment variable that you set in PyCharm will only be available to the project that you are currently working on.

## Section 4: Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned what environment variables are, why they are important, and how to set them in PyCharm using the `Environment Variables` dialog box. We have also learned how to access environment variables in our Python code using the `os` module. By setting environment variables correctly in your PyCharm project, you can make your code more secure and more reliable.
