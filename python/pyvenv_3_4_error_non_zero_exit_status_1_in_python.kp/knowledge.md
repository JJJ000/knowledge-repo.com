# Possible causes of pyvenv-3.4 non-zero exit status 1 

One of the most common causes of pyvenv-3.4 non-zero exit status 1 is that there might be package dependencies that are either missing or not installed correctly. This can occur if the package manager or the setup tools used are outdated or have issues with the operating system one may be using. Other possible causes could be incorrect permission settings, virtual environment path issues, or Python version conflicts.

# Troubleshooting steps to follow to resolve pyvenv-3.4 non-zero exit status 1

The following steps can be taken to troubleshoot pyvenv-3.4 non-zero exit status:

**1. Update package dependencies.** 
Updating package dependencies can help to resolve version conflicts or outdated package issues. Checking for updates through pip, the package manager usually used in Python, can make sure that the latest compatible version is installed.

**2. Check permission settings.**
The permission settings of the virtual environment directory should be checked to ensure that they have write and execute access. If the permission settings are incorrect, updates may not be able to be installed.

**3. Verify virtual environment path.**
If the virtual environment path is incorrect, it may cause the non-zero exit status on running pyvenv-3.4. The path should be set correctly, and the correct command should be issued. For instance, the correct command is "python3.4 -m venv path/to/new/virtual/environment." 

**4. Debug error message.**
The error message received after running pyvenv-3.4 should be thoroughly examined to determine the root cause of the error.

# Conclusion

Non-zero exit status 1 after running pyvenv-3.4 can occur due to package dependency issues, incorrect permission settings, path errors, and version conflicts. Troubleshooting should include updating package dependencies, checking permission settings, verifying the virtual environment path, and debugging error messages.
