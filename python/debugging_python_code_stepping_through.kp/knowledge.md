tldr: You can step through Python code to help debug issues by using a debugger, such as pdb or PyCharm`s debugger, to pause execution of the code at specific points and inspect the values of variables and data structures.

## Using Print Statements 

One of the simplest ways to step through Python code to help debug issues is by using print statements. This method involves adding print statements throughout the code to print out the values of variables at specific points in the execution. 

For instance, if there is an issue with a loop, you can add a print statement that outputs the value of the loop variable at each iteration. This can help you identify where things may be going wrong and narrow down the root cause of the problem. 

## Using Debuggers

Another more advanced way to step through Python code to help debug issues is by using debuggers. Debuggers are tools that can be used to stop execution at specific points in the code so you can inspect the state of the program. 

You can use a Python debugger, such as pdb or ipdb, to set breakpoints at specific lines of code and step through the program line by line. You can also examine the values of variables and call functions to test out different scenarios. 

## Adding Assertions 

Assertions are statements that check the correctness of code assumptions. You can use the assert statement to add assertions to your code that check that certain conditions hold at specific points in the execution. 

Adding assertions can be a useful way to catch potential issues early on in the development process. If an assertion fails, you can quickly identify where the problem is and fix it before it causes any further issues. 

## Using Logging 

Finally, you can use the built-in logging module to help you step through Python code to help debug issues. This method involves adding log statements throughout the code to log the values of variables and actions taken at specific points in the execution. 

Logging can be used to provide a detailed log of the program's execution, which can be helpful when working with complex systems. You can use different logging levels, such as debug or warning, to indicate the severity of issues or events, and specify different output formats, such as files or emails, to suit your needs.
