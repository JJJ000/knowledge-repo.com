[TOC]

## 1. Reading the File

Before we can read a file in reverse order, we first need to read the file normally. We can do this using the `open()` function in Python, which returns a file object.

```python
file = open("filename.txt")
```

This code will open the file named `filename.txt` for reading. If the file is in a different directory, you can specify the full path to the file.

## 2. Reading the File in Reverse Order

Now that we have a file object, we can read the file in reverse order. One way to do this is by using the `readlines()` method to read all the lines in the file into a list, and then reversing the list with the `reverse()` method.

```python
lines = file.readlines()
lines.reverse()
```

This code will read all the lines in the file into a list called `lines`, and then reverse the list so that the last line in the file is first.

## 3. Printing the File in Reverse Order

Once we have the file contents in reverse order, we can print them to the console or write them to a new file. To print the reversed lines to the console, we can use a `for` loop to iterate over the lines in reverse order.

```python
for line in lines:
    print(line)
```

This code will print each line in the reversed `lines` list to the console, starting with the last line in the file.

## 4. Closing the File

After we have finished reading the file, we should close the file using the `close()` method.

```python
file.close()
```

This code will close the file and free up system resources. Always remember to close your file after you have finished working with it.
