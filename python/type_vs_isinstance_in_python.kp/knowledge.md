tldr: type() returns the type of an object, while isinstance() checks if an object is an instance of a certain class.

# Type()
Type() is a built-in function that returns the type of an object. It takes one argument, which can be any object, and returns the type of that object.

# Isinstance()
Isinstance() is a built-in function that checks whether an object is an instance of a given class. It takes two arguments: the object to be tested and the class it is being tested against.

# Differences
1. Type() returns the type of an object, while isinstance() checks if an object is an instance of a given class.
2. Type() only takes one argument, while isinstance() takes two arguments.
3. Type() is used to determine the type of an object, while isinstance() is used to determine if an object is an instance of a given class.
