tldr: The `self` argument is needed in a Python method to refer to the specific instance of the class that the method is being called on.

Introduction

In object-oriented programming, Python uses the concept of objects and classes to structure code. A class is a blueprint of an object and each object created from a class is an instance of that class. An important aspect of writing classes in Python is understanding the use of the "self" argument in methods. In this article, we will discuss the reasons why we need to explicitly have the "self" argument in a Python method.

Section 1: Accessing class attributes and methods
The "self" argument is used to reference the object that is calling the method. When a method is called on an object, it needs to access the attributes and methods of that object. In order to do this, it needs a reference to the object. This is why the "self" argument is included in the method definition. It allows the method to access the attributes and methods of the object.


Section 2: Enabling modification of attribute values
In addition to accessing attributes and methods, the "self" argument also enables modification of attribute values. When a method is called on an object, it can modify the attributes of that object. This is done using the "self" argument as a reference to the object. Without the "self" argument, the method would have no way of knowing which object to modify.


Section 3: Differentiating between class and instance attributes
In Python, there are two types of attributes: class attributes and instance attributes. Class attributes are defined at the class level and are shared among all instances of that class. Instance attributes are defined at the instance level and are unique to each instance of the class. 
When using the "self" argument in a method, it helps to differentiate between these two types of attributes. If the method modifies an attribute, the "self" argument is used to modify the instance attribute. If the method only accesses an attribute, the "self" argument is used to access either the instance attribute or the class attribute.


Conclusion

In summary, the "self" argument is a necessary component in Python methods because it allows the method to access the attributes and methods of the calling object, modify attribute values, and differentiate between class and instance attributes. By understanding the role of the "self" argument in method definition, you can write cleaner, more efficient Python code.
