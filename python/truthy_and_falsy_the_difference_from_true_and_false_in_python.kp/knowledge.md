tldr: Truthy and Falsy are values in Python that are equivalent to True and False, respectively, but with some exceptions where non-boolean values can also be considered true or false.

Truthy and Falsy Values in Python

Truthy and falsy values are a concept in Python that refer to values that are considered true or false in a specific context. These values are used to determine the logic of different operations in Python. In other words, truthy and falsy values are used to determine whether a statement is true or false.

Truthy Values in Python

Truthy values are values that are considered true in a specific context. These values are non-zero numbers, non-empty containers, and non-empty strings. For example, if you have a list that contains elements or a string that has characters, then it is considered a truthy value.

Falsy Values in Python

Falsy values are values that are considered false in a specific context. These values are zero, empty containers, and empty strings. For example, if you have a list that is empty or a string that has no characters, then it is considered a falsy value.

Difference between Truthy/Falsy and True/False

Truthy and falsy values are different from true and false in Python. True and false are boolean values that represent true and false, respectively. These values are used to indicate the truth-value of a statement or an expression in Python.

On the other hand, truthy and falsy values are not boolean values but are considered to be true or false, depending on the context in which they are used. These values are used to determine whether a statement is true or false in Python.
