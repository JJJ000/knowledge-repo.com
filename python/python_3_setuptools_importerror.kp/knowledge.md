# Solution

## Installation

The easiest way to install setuptools on Windows is by using `pip`. To do this, open the command prompt and type:

```
pip install setuptools
```

This will install the latest version of setuptools. 

## Troubleshooting

If you are still getting the "No Module named Setuptools" error, then you may need to reinstall Python. This can be done by downloading the latest version from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and following the instructions for installation. 

## Alternative Solutions

If you are unable to install setuptools using `pip`, you can try using a different package manager such as `easy_install` or `conda`. These can be installed using the instructions provided on the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). 

Once installed, you can use the package manager to install setuptools by typing:

```
easy_install setuptools
```

or

```
conda install setuptools
```
