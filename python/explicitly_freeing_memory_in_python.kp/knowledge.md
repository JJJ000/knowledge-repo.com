tldr: Explicitly free memory in Python by using the del keyword to delete references to objects.

**Contents**

[TOC]

## Memory Management

Python uses a memory management system that automatically reclaims memory when objects are no longer needed. This means that, in most cases, there is no need to explicitly free memory in Python.

## Garbage Collection

Python uses a garbage collection system to reclaim memory that is no longer being used. This system automatically identifies and removes objects that are no longer referenced by the program.

## Reference Counting

Python uses a reference counting system to track how many references to an object exist. When the reference count of an object reaches zero, the object is automatically removed from memory.

## Manual Memory Management

In some cases, it may be necessary to explicitly free memory in Python. This can be done by manually deleting objects that are no longer needed. This can be done using the `del` keyword or by using the `gc.collect()` method.
