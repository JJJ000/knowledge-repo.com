# Increment Operator

The increment operator `++` is not supported in Python. However, the augmented assignment operator `+=` can be used to increment a variable.

# Decrement Operator

Similarly, the decrement operator `--` is not supported in Python. However, the augmented assignment operator `-=` can be used to decrement a variable.

# Usage

The augmented assignment operators can be used to increment or decrement a variable by any value. For example,

```
x += 1  # Increment x by 1
x -= 5  # Decrement x by 5
```

# Syntax

The syntax for using the augmented assignment operators is as follows:

`<variable> <operator>= <value>`
