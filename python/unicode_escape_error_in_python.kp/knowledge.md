# Overview

The "(unicode error) 'unicodeescape' codec can't decode bytes in position 2-3: truncated \UXXXXXXXX escape" error is an error that occurs in Python when attempting to decode a Unicode escape sequence that is incomplete. This error is caused by the Python interpreter not being able to decode the escape sequence because it is not valid.

# Causes

This error is usually caused by a typo or an incorrect escape sequence. For example, if a Unicode escape sequence is written as "\U1234567" instead of "\U12345678", the escape sequence will be truncated, resulting in this error.

# Solutions

The solution to this error is to ensure that the Unicode escape sequence is valid. This can be done by double-checking the Unicode escape sequence for typos and ensuring that it is complete. Additionally, it is recommended to use the Unicode code point to create the escape sequence, as it is easier to ensure that the escape sequence is valid.
