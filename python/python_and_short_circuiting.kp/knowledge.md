tldr: Yes, Python supports short-circuiting, meaning it will evaluate the left side of a logical expression first and then decide whether to evaluate the right side.

### Yes
Python supports short-circuiting. Short-circuiting is a programming technique that allows for the evaluation of a logical expression to be stopped as soon as the result can be determined.

### How it Works
In Python, short-circuiting works by evaluating the left-hand side of a logical expression first and then, if necessary, evaluating the right-hand side. If the left-hand side of the expression is false, then the right-hand side is not evaluated and the result is false. If the left-hand side of the expression is true, then the right-hand side is evaluated and the result is determined.

### Example
For example, consider the expression `x > 0 and x < 10`. If `x` is equal to `5`, then the left-hand side of the expression evaluates to `True` and the right-hand side is evaluated to determine the result. However, if `x` is equal to `-5`, then the left-hand side evaluates to `False` and the right-hand side is not evaluated, resulting in a `False` result.

### Benefits
Short-circuiting can be used to improve the performance of a program by avoiding unnecessary evaluations. It can also help to improve readability by making the logic of a program more explicit.
