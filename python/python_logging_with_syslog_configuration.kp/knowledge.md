## Section 1: Introduction to logging in Python

Logging is a critical aspect of software development as it helps developers in identifying the bugs and issues in the software application. In Python, the logging module is used to log messages from the application. The logging module provides various options to log message like to a file, to a console, or to a syslog server.

## Section 2: Configuring logging to syslog

In order to configure logging to syslog in Python, we need to follow the below steps:

1. Import the logging module `import logging` 
2. Set the logging level `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` 
3. Import SyslogHandler from logging.handlers `from logging.handlers import SysLogHandler` 
4. Set the syslog server and port `syslog = SysLogHandler(address=('syslog.server.com', 514))` 
5. Set the syslog facility (optional) `syslog = SysLogHandler(address=('syslog.server.com', 514), facility=SysLogHandler.LOG_USER)` 
6. Attach the syslog handler to logger `logger.addHandler(syslog)` 

## Section 3: Example of configuring logging to syslog in Python

```python
import logging
from logging.handlers import SysLogHandler

# Set the logging level
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Set the syslog server and port
syslog = SysLogHandler(address=('syslog.server.com', 514))

# Set the syslog facility (optional)
syslog = SysLogHandler(address=('syslog.server.com', 514), facility=SysLogHandler.LOG_USER)

# Attach the syslog handler to logger
logger.addHandler(syslog)

# Log a message
logger.info('Hello World!')
```

In the above example, we have configured the logging module to log messages to a syslog server. The `logging.basicConfig` method sets the logging level, and the `SysLogHandler` method sets the syslog server and port. Finally, we have attached the syslog handler to the logger and logged a message using the `logger` object. 

## Section 4: Conclusion

Logging to syslog is an efficient way to log messages from the application. We can configure the logging module to log messages to a syslog server by following the above-mentioned steps. With this configuration, we can easily monitor the application logs and identify the issues in the software application.
