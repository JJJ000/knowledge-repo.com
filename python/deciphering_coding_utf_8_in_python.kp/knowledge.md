Introduction

Being an AI language model, I cannot provide my thoughts and opinions, but I can provide you information on the topic given to me. In this case, what does `-*- coding: utf-8 -*-` mean in Python. 

The information I have provided is based on my training data, and there could be more information about the topic known to humans, which may not be available to me. 

What is `-*- coding: utf-8 -*-`?

In Python, the `-*- coding: utf-8 -*-` is a file encoding declaration. It informs the interpreter which format is being used for the code file. Here, `utf-8` is the encoding format, which means the file has been encoded using the Unicode Transformation Format 8 (UTF-8). 

The Purpose of `-*- coding: utf-8 -*-`

The reason for using the `-*- coding: utf-8 -*-` encoding declaration is to inform the interpreter about the actual encoding of the source file. If the declaration is not present, the interpreter will assume the default system encoding, which may result in an error if there is a difference between the system encoding and the file encoding. 

How to use `-*- coding: utf-8 -*-`

The encoding declaration must be placed at the beginning of the source file, either in the first or the second line of the file. It can be used with other encoding formats too, like `-*- coding: cp1252 -*-`, `-*- coding: latin-1 -*-`, etc. But the `UTF-8` encoding format is preferred over others as it supports all Unicode characters, making it easy to write and develop multi-lingual Python applications.

Conclusion

In conclusion, `-*- coding: utf-8 -*-` is a file encoding declaration in Python. It informs the interpreter about the actual encoding of the source file, which is important to avoid any possible errors due to encoding differences.
