tldr: In Python 3, the xrange function was replaced by the range function, which is more efficient and easier to use.

#### Deprecation of xrange
The xrange function in Python2 was used to generate a sequence of numbers, similar to the range function. However, the xrange function generated a generator object instead of a list. This allowed for a more memory efficient approach. 

In Python3, the range function was modified to produce a generator object, so the xrange function was no longer needed. As a result, it was deprecated and removed from Python3. 

#### Benefits of Deprecating xrange
The deprecation of the xrange function provides several benefits. First, it simplifies the language by removing an unnecessary function. Second, it improves the efficiency of programs by allowing range to generate a generator object more efficiently. Third, it reduces the amount of code needed to write programs, as the same function can be used to generate both lists and generators. 

#### Alternatives to xrange
Though the xrange function was removed from Python3, there are several alternatives that can be used to achieve the same results. The range function can be used to generate a generator object, or the itertools module can be used to create a generator object from a range of numbers. Additionally, the built-in enumerate and zip functions can be used to generate generator objects from existing lists.
