tldr: Use the `urljoin()` function from the `urllib.parse` module.

# Introduction
When working with web development in Python, it is common to construct URLs by joining together different components of a path. This can include a base URL, endpoint, and any parameters or query strings. In this guide, we will discuss how to join these components together to form a complete URL in Python.

# Using the urlparse Library
One common way to join together components of a path is to use the `urlparse` library. This library provides functions for parsing and manipulating URLs. To use it, we first import the library:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin, urlparse
```

We can then use the `urljoin` function to join a base URL and an endpoint together:

```python
base_url = "https://example.com"
endpoint = "/api/users"
url = urljoin(base_url, endpoint)
```

This will result in the `url` variable containing the string `"https://example.com/api/users"`.

# Using String Concatenation
Another way to join together components of a path is to use string concatenation. This involves simply adding together the different components of the path using the `+` operator. For example:

```python
base_url = "https://example.com"
endpoint = "/api/users"
url = base_url + endpoint
```

This will also result in the `url` variable containing the string `"https://example.com/api/users"`. However, it is worth noting that using string concatenation can be less flexible than using the `urlparse` library, as it requires us to manually handle any slashes or query strings that need to be included in the final URL.

# Using Template Strings
A third way to join together components of a path is to use Python's template strings. This involves using a special syntax that allows us to insert variable values into a string. For example:

```python
from string import Template

base_url = "https://example.com"
endpoint = "/api/users"

t = Template('$base$endpoint')
url = t.substitute(base=base_url, endpoint=endpoint)
```

This will also result in the `url` variable containing the string `"https://example.com/api/users"`. One advantage of using template strings is that it allows us to easily change the format of the URL without needing to modify any additional code. However, like string concatenation, it requires us to manually handle any slashes or query strings that need to be included in the final URL.

# Conclusion
In summary, there are several ways to join together components of a path when constructing a URL in Python. These include using the `urlparse` library, string concatenation, and Python's template strings. Each of these methods has its own advantages and disadvantages, and the best approach will depend on the specific requirements of your project.
