Section 1: Introduction

Scipy is a powerful Python library that provides various modules for scientific and technical computing. It includes modules for optimization, integration, interpolation, signal and image processing, linear algebra, statistics, and more. One of the most useful modules in Scipy is the stats module, which provides functions to work with probability distributions. Scipy makes it easy to fit an empirical distribution to a theoretical one, which is an important task in statistical analysis. In this tutorial, we will show you how to fit empirical distributions to theoretical ones using Scipy.

Section 2: Fitting Empirical Distributions

In statistics, empirical distribution refers to the distribution of a sample. The theoretical distribution, on the other hand, is a distribution that is used to model the population from which the sample is drawn. The process of fitting an empirical distribution to a theoretical one involves finding the parameters of the theoretical distribution that best fit the sample.

Scipy provides a function called 'fit' that can be used to fit various probability distributions. The 'fit' function takes two arguments, the data and the name of the distribution to be fitted. For example, to fit a normal distribution to a set of data, we would use the following code:

```python
#importing necessary library
from scipy.stats import norm
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#generate some random data
data = np.random.normal(size=1000)

#get the parameters of the normal distribution that best fit the data
mu, std = norm.fit(data)

#plot the histogram of the data with the best-fit normal distribution
plt.hist(data, bins=25, density=True, alpha=0.6, color='g')
# PDF(Probability Density Function) for normal distribution with mu and std
xmin, xmax = plt.xlim()
x = np.linspace(xmin, xmax, 100)
p = norm.pdf(x, mu, std)
plt.plot(x, p, 'k', linewidth=2)
plt.show()
```

Here, we generated some random data using the 'numpy' library and then used the 'norm.fit' function to find the parameters of the normal distribution that best fit the data. We then plotted a histogram of the data with the best-fit normal distribution using the 'matplotlib' library.

Section 3: Fitting Other Distributions

Scipy provides functions for fitting a wide range of probability distributions. Some of the most commonly used distributions are:

1. Normal Distribution
2. Exponential Distribution
3. Gamma Distribution
4. Lognormal Distribution
5. Weibull Distribution
6. Chi-Square Distribution
7. Beta Distribution
8. Pareto Distribution
9. Rayleigh Distribution

To fit any of these distributions to a set of data, we can simply replace the name of the distribution in the 'fit' function with the name of the desired distribution. For example, to fit an exponential distribution, we would use the following code:

```python
from scipy.stats import expon

#generate some random data
data = np.random.exponential(size=1000)

#get the parameters of the exponential distribution that best fit the data
param = expon.fit(data)

#plot the histogram of the data with the best-fit exponential distribution
plt.hist(data, bins=25, density=True, alpha=0.6, color='g')
xmin, xmax = plt.xlim()
x = np.linspace(xmin, xmax, 100)
# PDF(Probability Density Function) for exponential distribution with parameter (lambda)
p = expon.pdf(x, *param)
plt.plot(x, p, 'k', linewidth=2)
plt.show()
```

Similarly, we can replace 'expon' with the name of any other distribution to fit that distribution to the data.

Section 4: Conclusion

Fitting empirical distributions to theoretical ones is an important task in statistical analysis. Scipy provides a convenient way to perform this task using the 'fit' function in the stats module. We have shown how to use this function to fit a range of probability distributions to data using examples of normal and exponential distributions. Scipy provides functions for many other distributions which can be used in the same way to fit those distributions to data.
