## Benefits of Copying
Making a copy of a data frame in pandas allows you to modify the copy without changing the original data frame. This makes it easy to experiment with different modifications without having to worry about affecting the original data frame.

## When to Copy
It is always a good idea to make a copy of a data frame before making any changes. This will ensure that the original data frame is not affected by any modifications made to the copy.

## How to Copy
Making a copy of a data frame in pandas is simple. All you need to do is use the `copy()` method:
```
df_copy = df.copy()
```
This will create a new data frame with the same data as the original data frame.

## Conclusion
Making a copy of a data frame in pandas is an important step when making modifications to a data frame. It ensures that the original data frame is not affected by any changes made to the copy.
