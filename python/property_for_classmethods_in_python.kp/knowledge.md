tldr: `property()` can be used on `classmethods` in Python just like regular instance methods, with the `@property` decorator applied to the method.

[TOC]

Section 1: Introduction to classmethods
---------------------------------------

In Python, a classmethod is a special type of method that is bound to the class rather than to an instance of the class. This means that when a classmethod is called, it receives the class itself as the first argument, rather than an instance of the class. 

Classmethods are typically used to define methods that operate on the class itself, rather than on instances of the class. For example, a class method can be used to create a new instance of the class, or to perform some operation that updates the state of the class itself.

Section 2: Using property() on classmethods
--------------------------------------------

In Python, the `property()` function can be used to define getter/setter methods for class attributes. These methods can be used to control access to the attribute, and can be especially useful for computed attributes or for attributes that need to be validated or transformed in some way.

While `property()` is typically used with instance methods, it can also be used with classmethods. When used with a classmethod, the `property()` function returns a descriptor object that can be used to get or set the attribute value associated with the class.

Here's an example of using `property()` with a classmethod:

```python
class MyClass:
    _my_attribute = None

    @classmethod
    def get_my_attribute(cls):
        return cls._my_attribute

    @classmethod 
    def set_my_attribute(cls, value):
        cls._my_attribute = value

    my_attribute = property(get_my_attribute, set_my_attribute)
```

In this example, we define a class `MyClass` with a class attribute `_my_attribute`. We then define two classmethods `get_my_attribute()` and `set_my_attribute()` to get and set the value of `_my_attribute` respectively. Finally, we define a computed attribute `my_attribute` using the `property()` function, passing in `get_my_attribute` and `set_my_attribute` as the getter and setter methods.

Section 3: Using property() with decorators
---------------------------------------------

In addition to using `property()` with classmethods directly, we can also use the built-in `@property` and `@my_attribute.setter` decorators to make it even easier to define computed attributes on our class.

Here's how we could modify the previous example to use decorators instead of calling `property()` directly:

```python
class MyClass:
    _my_attribute = None

    @classmethod
    def get_my_attribute(cls):
        return cls._my_attribute

    @classmethod 
    def set_my_attribute(cls, value):
        cls._my_attribute = value

    @property
    def my_attribute(cls):
        return MyClass.get_my_attribute()

    @my_attribute.setter
    def my_attribute(cls, value):
        MyClass.set_my_attribute(value)
```

In this example, we define the same classmethods `get_my_attribute()` and `set_my_attribute()` as before, but this time we use the `@property` decorator to define a computed attribute `my_attribute`. We then use the `@my_attribute.setter` decorator to define the setter method for `my_attribute`.

Section 4: Conclusion
----------------------

In conclusion, using `property()` with classmethods in Python can be a powerful technique for defining computed attributes on your classes. By using `property()` directly or by using decorators, you can control access to your class attributes in a way that is both flexible and extensible.
