tldr: The loop count inside a for-loop in Python is determined by the number of items in the iterable object used in the loop.

# Section 1: Definition
A loop count is the number of times a loop will run before it is complete.

# Section 2: Syntax
The syntax for a for-loop in Python is as follows:

```
for i in range(n):
   # code to be executed
```

Where n is the loop count.

# Section 3: Example
For example, if we wanted to loop 10 times, we would set n to 10:

```
for i in range(10):
   print(i)
```

# Section 4: Output
The output of this code would be the numbers 0 through 9 printed to the console.
