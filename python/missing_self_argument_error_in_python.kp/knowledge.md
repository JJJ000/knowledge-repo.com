# Introduction

The TypeError: Missing 1 required positional argument: 'self' in Python is a common error encountered when working with classes and object-oriented programming. This error occurs when a method or function is called without providing the required self argument. The self argument is a reference to the current instance of the class and is used to access the attributes and methods of the class. 

# Causes of Error 

The most common cause of this error is when a method or function is called without providing the self argument. This can happen when a method is called without an object instance or when a function is called without passing in the self argument. 

# Solutions 

The solution to this error is to ensure that the self argument is passed into the method or function when it is called. This can be done by providing the object instance when calling the method or by passing in the self argument when calling the function.
