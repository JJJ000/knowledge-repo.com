# Using the break Statement
The break statement can be used to break out of multiple loops. To break out of multiple loops, you can use a flag variable to control the outer loop and break out of the inner loop. The flag variable is set to False when the inner loop has finished executing. When the outer loop is encountered, the flag is checked. If the flag is False, the outer loop is broken. 

# Using the continue Statement
The continue statement can also be used to break out of multiple loops. The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next one. This can be used to break out of multiple loops by using a control variable to control the outer loop and using the continue statement to break out of the inner loop. 

# Using the try-except Statement
The try-except statement can also be used to break out of multiple loops. The try-except statement is used to catch exceptions that may occur while executing the code. The code inside the try block is executed and if an exception is encountered, the code inside the except block is executed. This can be used to break out of multiple loops by using a control variable to control the outer loop and using the try-except statement to break out of the inner loop. 

# Using the return Statement
The return statement can also be used to break out of multiple loops. The return statement is used to return a value from a function. This can be used to break out of multiple loops by using a control variable to control the outer loop and using the return statement to break out of the inner loop.
