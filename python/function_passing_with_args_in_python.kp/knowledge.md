Section 1: Introduction
Python is a powerful programming language that offers a lot of flexibility when it comes to defining and calling functions. It allows users to pass functions as arguments to other functions, thereby making the code more modular and easy to maintain. In this article, we will explore how to pass functions with arguments to another function in Python.

Section 2: Defining Functions in Python
Before we dive into passing functions as arguments to another function, let's first understand how to define a function in Python. A function in Python can be defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name, parameters (if any), and the code block that defines the function's behavior. For example, let's consider a simple function that takes two arguments and returns their sum:

```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

Here, we have defined a function named `add` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns their sum.

Section 3: Passing Functions as Arguments to Another Function
Now that we know how to define a function in Python, let's see how to pass functions as arguments to another function. To pass a function as an argument, we simply need to use the function name as an argument in the calling function. For instance, consider the following function that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and a function `func` as a third argument:

```python
def apply_func(a, b, func):
    return func(a, b)
```

Here, the `apply_func` function takes two arguments `a` and `b` and a third argument `func`, which is a function. The `apply_func` function then calls the `func` function with the arguments `a` and `b` and returns the result. Here's how we can call the `apply_func` function with the `add` function as an argument:

```python
result = apply_func(2, 3, add)
print(result)   # Output: 5
```

In this example, we passed the `add` function as an argument to the `apply_func` function. The `apply_func` function then called the `add` function with the arguments `2` and `3` and returned the result, which is `5`.

Section 4: Passing Functions with Arguments to Another Function
Finally, let's see how to pass functions that have arguments as arguments to another function. Consider the following function that takes a function `func` and two additional arguments `a` and `b`:

```python
def apply_func_with_args(func, a, b):
    return func(a, b)
```

Here, the `apply_func_with_args` function takes three arguments: a function `func`, and two additional arguments `a` and `b`. The `apply_func_with_args` function then calls the `func` function with the arguments `a` and `b` and returns the result. Here's how we can call the `apply_func_with_args` function with the `add` function as an argument:

```python
result = apply_func_with_args(add, 2, 3)
print(result)   # Output: 5
```

In this example, we passed the `add` function as an argument to the `apply_func_with_args` function along with the additional arguments `2` and `3`. The `apply_func_with_args` function then called the `add` function with the arguments `2` and `3` and returned the result, which is `5`.
