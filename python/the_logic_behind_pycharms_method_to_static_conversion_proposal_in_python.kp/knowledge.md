tldr: PyCharm proposes to change method to static in Python when the method does not use instance variables to improve performance and avoid accidental modification of instance variables.

# Introduction
PyCharm is an integrated development environment (IDE) used for developing applications using the Python programming language. One important feature of PyCharm is its ability to analyze code and make suggestions for improvements. One such suggestion is to change a method to a static method.

# What is a static method?
A static method is a method that belongs to the class rather than to an instance of the class. This means that the method can be called without creating an instance of the class. Static methods are often used for utility functions that do not depend on any state of the class.

# Why does PyCharm propose to change a method to static?
PyCharm proposes to change a method to static when it detects that the method does not depend on any state of the instance. If a method does not use any instance variables or methods, it can be made static. This can improve performance and make the code easier to read and understand.

# Benefits of using static methods
Static methods have a number of benefits, including:

1. Improved performance - Since static methods do not need to access instance variables or methods, they can be faster than instance methods.

2. Easier to read and understand - Because static methods do not depend on any state of the instance, they can be easier to read and understand than instance methods.

3. Encapsulation - Using static methods can help to encapsulate functionality within a class and prevent it from being accessed outside the class. This can help to improve the overall design and architecture of the application. 

# Conclusion
PyCharm proposes to change a method to static when it detects that the method does not depend on any state of the instance. Static methods have benefits such as improved performance and encapsulation, making the code easier to read and understand.
