tldr: Yes, two unordered lists can be compared for equality using the `==` operator.

**Solution 1: Using Sets**

1. Create Sets: The first step is to convert both the lists into sets. Sets are unordered collections of unique items. 

2. Compare Sets: Once the sets have been created, we can use the comparison operators (==, !=, etc.) to compare the two sets. 

3. Return Result: Finally, we can return a boolean value (True or False) based on the comparison result.

**Solution 2: Using Sorted Lists**

1. Sort Lists: The first step is to sort both the lists in ascending order.

2. Compare Sorted Lists: Once the lists have been sorted, we can use the comparison operators (==, !=, etc.) to compare the two lists. 

3. Return Result: Finally, we can return a boolean value (True or False) based on the comparison result.
