1. Explanation of the Error
The error "AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute 'urlopen'" occurs when the method 'urlopen' is called from a module that doesn't have it. The 'urlopen' method is a function of the urllib module that can be used to open URLs.

2. Causes of the Error
There are two possible causes for this error:
- The Python version being used is outdated, and the 'urllib' module is not yet installed or is not functional.
- The 'urllib' module is not imported correctly or may be missing from the Python environment in use.

3. Solutions to the Error
There are several solutions to this error, which include:
- Checking the Python version being used and updating it if necessary.
- Confirming that the 'urllib' module is installed or reinstalling it to ensure it is functional.
- Checking the import statement for the 'urllib' module at the beginning of the script or ensuring that the module is correctly referenced.

4. Example Solution
import urllib.request

url = "www.example.com"
req = urllib.request.urlopen(url)
result = req.read()
print(result)

This script imports the 'urllib.request module and then uses the 'urlopen' method to open a URL specified by the 'url' variable. The 'req.read()' method is then used to read the contents of the URL before printing the result. This is an example of how to use the 'urlopen' method correctly.
