tldr: No, there is no way to perform an `if` statement in a Python lambda expression.

1. Using `if` Statements in Lambda Expressions
--------------------------------------------

Yes, it is possible to use `if` statements in lambda expressions. Lambda expressions are anonymous functions, which means they can contain any valid expression, including `if` statements. The syntax for using an `if` statement in a lambda expression is as follows:

```python
lambda x: True if condition else False
```

2. Example of an `if` Statement in a Lambda Expression
--------------------------------------------------------

Here is an example of a lambda expression that uses an `if` statement:

```python
lambda x: x**2 if x>0 else 0
```

This lambda expression takes a single argument, `x`, and will return the square of `x` if `x` is greater than 0, otherwise it will return 0.

3. Benefits of Using `if` Statements in Lambda Expressions
----------------------------------------------------------

Using `if` statements in lambda expressions can be useful for simplifying code and making it more concise. For example, instead of writing a function with multiple `if` statements, you can write a single lambda expression that contains all of the logic in one line. This can make the code easier to read and debug.

4. Limitations of Using `if` Statements in Lambda Expressions
------------------------------------------------------------

Although `if` statements can be used in lambda expressions, it is important to note that they are limited in what they can do. Lambda expressions can only contain a single expression, so they cannot contain multiple `if` statements or `else` statements. Additionally, lambda expressions cannot contain any statements that have side effects, such as `print` statements or assignments.
