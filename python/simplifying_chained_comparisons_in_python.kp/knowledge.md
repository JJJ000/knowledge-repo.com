tldr: You can use the `and` operator to combine multiple comparison operators into a single expression.

# Section 1: What is Chained Comparison?
Chained comparison is a way of combining multiple comparison operators in a single expression. It allows for the comparison of multiple values in a single line.

# Section 2: Examples of Chained Comparison
The following are examples of chained comparison:

```
a < b < c
a <= b < c
a < b <= c
a <= b <= c
```

# Section 3: How to Simplify Chained Comparison
Chained comparison can be simplified by using the logical operators "and" and "or". For example, the expression "a < b < c" can be simplified to "a < b and b < c".

# Section 4: Benefits of Simplifying Chained Comparison
Simplifying chained comparison can make code more readable, as it reduces the number of comparison operators used. It can also help to reduce the complexity of the code, making it easier to debug.
