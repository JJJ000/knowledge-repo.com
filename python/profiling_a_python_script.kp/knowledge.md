tldr: Run the script with the cProfile module to profile it.

1. Install a Profiler 

Python comes with a built-in profiler called cProfile. To use it, import the cProfile module and call the cProfile.run() function, passing the name of the script file as an argument. This will run the script and generate a profile report.

2. Analyze the Report 

Once the script is executed, the profiler will generate a report. The report contains a list of the functions called and how long each function took to execute. This information can be used to identify which functions are taking the most time to execute and could be optimized.

3. Optimize the Code 

Once the bottlenecks are identified, the code can be optimized to reduce the execution time. This could involve making changes to the code, such as using more efficient algorithms, using caching, or using more efficient data structures.

4. Repeat the Process 

After the code is optimized, the script should be re-profiled to ensure that the changes have had the desired effect. This process can be repeated until the desired performance is achieved.
