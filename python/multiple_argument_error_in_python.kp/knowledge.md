### What is a TypeError
A TypeError is an exception raised when an operation or function is applied to an object of an inappropriate type. It is a built-in exception in Python that is raised when incorrect types are used in an operation or function.

### Causes of TypeError
A TypeError can occur when a function or operation is applied to an object of an inappropriate type. This could be due to a mismatch between the types of the objects being operated on, or it could be due to the function or operation expecting a different type of object than what was provided.

### Examples of TypeError
One example of a TypeError is when a function that expects a string is passed an integer. Another example is when a function that expects an integer is passed a string. A third example is when a function that expects a list is passed a dictionary.

### How to Avoid TypeError
To avoid TypeError, it is important to ensure that the types of the objects being operated on are compatible with the function or operation. It is also important to make sure that any inputs to a function or operation are of the expected type. Additionally, it is important to check for type errors when writing code and to debug any errors that occur.
