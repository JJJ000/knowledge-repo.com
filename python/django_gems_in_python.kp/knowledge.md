1. Model Relationships: 
Djangoâ€™s ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) makes it easy to create relationships between models. This allows developers to create complex data models and relationships without writing any SQL.

2. Django Admin: 
Django comes with a built-in admin interface that allows developers to quickly create, update and delete data in the database. This makes it easy to manage data and makes development much faster.

3. Template System: 
Django has a powerful template system that allows developers to quickly create HTML pages from their models. This makes it easy to create dynamic webpages with minimal effort.

4. Security: 
Django provides a lot of security features out of the box. This includes authentication, authorization, and protection against common web attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting.
