**Contents**

[TOC]

# Overview

`.view()` is a PyTorch function that allows a tensor to be reshaped without changing its data. It is used to make efficient use of memory and to enable operations on tensors with different shapes.

# Usage

`.view()` takes in a tensor and a new shape as arguments. The new shape must have the same number of elements as the original tensor. It then returns a reshaped tensor with the same data as the original but with the new shape.

# Examples

For example, if we have a tensor of shape (4, 5, 6) and we want to reshape it to (2, 10, 3), we can use `.view()` like this:

`tensor = tensor.view(2, 10, 3)`

# Benefits

Using `.view()` can help reduce memory usage and enable operations on tensors with different shapes. It can also make code more readable and efficient.
