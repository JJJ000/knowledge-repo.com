**Contents**

[TOC]

#### Yes

It is possible to add comments to a pip requirements file in Python. Comments are lines that are not read by the interpreter, and are used to provide information or explain code. In Python, comments can be added to a pip requirements file by beginning the line with a `#` symbol.

#### Example

For example, the following code shows a pip requirements file with a comment:

```
# This is a comment
requests==2.24.0
```

#### Benefits

Adding comments to a pip requirements file can be useful for providing additional context or information about the packages that are being installed. This can be helpful for other developers who may be working on the project, or for future reference.

#### Caveats

It is important to note that comments in a pip requirements file must be on a separate line from the package name and version. If the comment is on the same line as the package name and version, it will be interpreted as part of the package name and will result in an error.
