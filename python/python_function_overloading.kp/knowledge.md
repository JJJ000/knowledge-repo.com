tldr: Function overloading in Python is not supported, but the same effect can be achieved by using default arguments.

# Introduction
Function overloading is a feature in Python that allows a programmer to define multiple functions with the same name but different parameters. This allows the programmer to create functions that can be used for different purposes with different sets of parameters.

# How it Works
When a function is called, Python looks for the function definition that matches the parameters that were passed to it. If a match is found, then the associated function is called. If no match is found, then an error is thrown.

# Advantages
Function overloading allows for code reuse and makes it easier to use functions for different purposes. It also makes it easier to read and understand code, as the same function name can be used for multiple purposes.

# Disadvantages
Function overloading can be difficult to maintain, as it can lead to a lot of duplicate code. It can also be difficult to debug, as the same function name can be used for different purposes.
