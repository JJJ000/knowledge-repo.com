## Definition

`pyproject.toml` is a configuration file in Python that is used to define various aspects of a project including its dependencies, build tools, and other project metadata.

## Usage & Purpose

The `pyproject.toml` file is used in combination with the [PEP 517](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0517/) standard to provide a standardized build interface for Python projects, which allows for more efficient builds and reduces build time.

Additionally, the file can be used to specify dependencies and versions required for the project, specify the build system or tool, and declare the minimum required version of Python.

It provides a simple process for packaging, testing, building, and installing a Python package.

## Syntax

The `pyproject.toml` file uses the [TOML (Tom's Obvious, Minimal Language)](https://toml.io/en/) format, which is a lightweight and easy-to-read syntax for configuration files.

The following is an example `pyproject.toml` file:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=40.8.0", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

This file specifies that the project requires `setuptools` and `wheel` as build requirements, and that the build tool used is `setuptools.build_meta`.

## Conclusion

In summary, the `pyproject.toml` file is a configuration file used in Python projects to declare project metadata, dependencies, and build tools. It helps to create a standardized build process and produces a more efficient build of your Python package.
