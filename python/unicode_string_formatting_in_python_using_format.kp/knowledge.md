I. Introduction
In Python, Unicode is used to represent characters from different languages and scripts. Sometimes, we may need to escape Unicode characters in strings. Using the .format() method on such Unicode-escaped strings can be tricky. This article will discuss how to use .format() on a Unicode-escaped string.

II. Unicode-Escaped Strings
Unicode-escaped strings contain escaped sequences of Unicode characters. For example, the string "\u00E9" represents the character "é" in Unicode. Similarly, the string "\u005C" represents the backslash character "\" in Unicode.

III. Using .format() on Unicode-Escaped Strings
When using .format() on Unicode-escaped strings, we need to be careful about the escaping. We can use either double braces "{{" and "}}" to escape curly brackets, or backslash "\" to escape other characters. Here's an example:

```
text = "This is a Unicode-escaped string: \\u00E9"
formatted = "Here is the escaped character: {0}".format(text)
print(formatted)
```

In the above code, we first define a Unicode-escaped string "text" containing the character "é". We then create a format string "formatted" that references "text" using the .format() method. Note that we need to escape the backslash character in "text" by adding another backslash before it. The output of the code will be:

```
Here is the escaped character: This is a Unicode-escaped string: \u00E9
```

As you can see, the output includes the entire Unicode-escaped string. This is because the .format() method treats the backslash character as an escape character, and removes the escaping.

IV. Conclusion
In summary, using .format() on a Unicode-escaped string requires us to escape the escape characters. We can use double braces or backslash to escape the characters, depending on the context. With this knowledge, we can use .format() to format Unicode-escaped strings as desired.
