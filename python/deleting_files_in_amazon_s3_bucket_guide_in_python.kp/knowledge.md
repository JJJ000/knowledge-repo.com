tldr: To delete files from Amazon S3 bucket in Python, you can use the `boto3` library and call the `delete\_object()` method on your S3 bucket object.

## Importing Required Libraries
The first thing we need to do is import the required libraries. In our case, we require "boto3", which is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python.


```python
import boto3
```

## Creating an S3 Client
The second step is to create an S3 client. 

```python
s3 = boto3.client("s3")
```

## Deleting an Object 
Now we will delete a file from the S3 bucket using the following code: 

```python
bucket_name = "your_bucket_name"
key = "your_file_key"

s3.delete_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=key)
```

Here, replace the "your_bucket_name" with your actual bucket name and the "your_file_key" with your actual file key. 

## Deleting All Objects in a Bucket
If you want to delete all the objects in a bucket, you can use the following code: 

```python
bucket_name = "your_bucket_name"

response = s3.list_objects_v2(Bucket=bucket_name)

for object in response.get("Contents", []):
    s3.delete_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=object["Key"])
```

Here, replace the "your_bucket_name" with your actual bucket name. 

This code will first list all the objects in a bucket, and then use a for loop to delete all the objects one by one.
