## Introduction
Flask is a powerful Python framework used for web development. Sometimes, you may need to read data from files in your Flask application. However, you might not want to save that data in your application for various reasons. In this tutorial, we will learn how to read file data without saving it in Flask in Python.

## Using File Objects
The most common way to read data from files in Python is by using file objects. However, instead of opening a file directly, we can use a file-like object that doesn't actually write to the filesystem. We can create the file-like object using the io module's StringIO or BytesIO classes. Then, we can read data from the file as we would normally.

```python
from io import StringIO

@app.route('/read_data')
def read_data():
    data = "sample data"
    file_obj = StringIO(data)
    file_contents = file_obj.read()
    return file_contents
```

Here, we created a file object using the StringIO class and passed it the string data. We then read the contents of the file object and returned it in the response.

## Using Temporary Files
Another approach to reading file data without saving it is by using temporary files. Python's tempfile module provides us with the tools to create temporary files and directories.

```python
import tempfile

@app.route('/read_data')
def read_data():
    data = "sample data"
    with tempfile.TemporaryFile(mode='w+t') as temp_file:
        temp_file.write(data)
        temp_file.seek(0)
        file_contents = temp_file.read()
    return file_contents
```

Here, we used the TemporaryFile context manager to create a file object that gets automatically deleted when we are done with it. We wrote the data to the file object and then read its contents.

## Using Memory Mapping
Memory mapping is a technique used to access data in files without actually reading the file contents into memory. Instead, a mapping is created between the file on disk and a range of virtual memory. We can use Python's mmap module to create memory maps.

```python
import mmap
import os

@app.route('/read_data')
def read_data():
    data = "sample data"
    with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as temp_file:
        temp_file.write(data)
        temp_file.flush()
        with open(temp_file.name, "r+b") as file_handle:
            map = mmap.mmap(file_handle.fileno(), 0)
            file_contents = map.read()
            map.close()
    os.unlink(temp_file.name)

    return file_contents
```

In this code snippet, we used the NamedTemporaryFile function to create a temporary file on disk. We wrote the data to the file and synced it to the filesystem. We then opened the file in read and write mode and created a memory map using the mmap module. Finally, we read the contents of the memory map and deleted the temporary file.

## Conclusion
Reading file data without saving it in Flask can be accomplished using different Python modules and techniques. In this tutorial, we explored three ways of achieving this: using file-like objects, temporary files, and memory maps. Choose the technique that best suits your use case, and use it to read files in your Flask application.
