tldr: Python automatically deallocates memory when an object is no longer referenced or used in the program.

## Introduction
Python uses automatic memory management, which means that it handles the allocation and deallocation of memory automatically. The system keeps track of all memory usage as long as your program is running. However, in certain situations, it may be necessary to release memory explicitly. This can be achieved using a few different techniques.

## Garbage Collection
Garbage collection is the process by which Python automatically frees up memory for objects that are no longer needed. Python uses a reference counting mechanism to keep track of how many references are pointing to an object. Once the references go to zero, the object is marked for garbage collection. The garbage collector runs periodically and frees up the memory occupied by these objects. However, sometimes it may be necessary to manually trigger the garbage collector using the `gc` module.

```python
import gc
gc.collect()
```

This method frees up all objects that are no longer in use by your program and can significantly reduce memory usage.

## Deleting Object References
Another way to release memory in Python is to delete object references after they are no longer needed. Once an object no longer has any references pointing to it, it is immediately marked for garbage collection. This can be achieved by using the `del` keyword in Python.

```python
my_large_list = [1,2,3,4,5]
del my_large_list
```

This will instantly free up the memory used by `my_large_list`.

## Using Generators
A generator is a special type of function that generates data on the fly. Since it generates data incrementally, it can significantly reduce memory consumption. It can be used to iterate over large datasets without having to load the entire dataset into memory at once. This can be achieved using the `yield` keyword in Python.

``` python
def read_large_file(file):
    while True:
        data = file.readline()
        if not data:
            break
        yield data

with open('large_file.txt') as f:
    for line in read_large_file(f):
        print(line)
```

In this example, we have a file `large_file.txt` that is too large to fit into memory. The `read_large_file` function reads the file one line at a time and yields each line as it is read. This means that we only ever have one line of the file in memory at any given time.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, there are various techniques that you can use to release memory in Python. The most common techniques include triggering the garbage collector manually, deleting object references, and using generators. By using these techniques, you can reduce memory usage and improve the performance of your Python programs.
