Section 1: Introduction
-----------------------
Multiple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two or more independent variables and a dependent variable. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. In Python, multiple linear regression can be easily implemented using the scikit-learn library.

Section 2: Data Preparation
---------------------------
To perform multiple linear regression, we need a dataset with independent variables and a dependent variable. The dataset should also be split into training and testing sets. The first step is to import the dataset and split it into independent and dependent variables. Then, we split the dataset into training and testing sets using sklearn’s train_test_split function.

Section 3: Model Creation
-------------------------
After splitting the dataset, we create a multiple linear regression model using the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn. We fit the model to the training data using the fit method.

Section 4: Model Evaluation
---------------------------
Finally, we evaluate the performance of the model by predicting the dependent variable for the testing set and comparing it with the actual values. We use metrics such as mean squared error, R-squared value, and mean absolute error to evaluate the model’s performance. We can also visualize the regression line using seaborn or matplotlib.
