[TOC]

## Section 1: Overview
The .mat file format is a binary file format used to store data in a MATLAB-specific format. It is used to store both numerical and non-numerical data, such as images and text. MATLABâ€™s .mat files can be read and written in Python using the scipy.io.loadmat and scipy.io.savemat functions, respectively. 

## Section 2: Prerequisites
In order to read and write .mat files in Python, the following packages must be installed: 
- Numpy
- Scipy
- Matplotlib

## Section 3: Reading .mat Files
The scipy.io.loadmat() function can be used to read a .mat file in Python. This function takes a single argument, which is a string containing the path to the .mat file. The function returns a dictionary containing the contents of the file. 

## Section 4: Writing .mat Files
The scipy.io.savemat() function can be used to write a .mat file in Python. This function takes two arguments, the first is a string containing the path to the .mat file, and the second is a dictionary containing the data to be written to the file.
