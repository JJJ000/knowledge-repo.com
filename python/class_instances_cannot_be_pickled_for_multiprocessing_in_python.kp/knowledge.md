tldr: Python`s pickle library cannot serialize instance methods, leading to the `Can`t pickle <type `instancemethod`> error when attempting to use multiprocessing Pool.map().

Section 1: Explanation of the Error

The error message, "Can't pickle <type 'instancemethod'>," often occurs when trying to use the multiprocessing library in Python with the map() function. This error message is caused because Python's pickle module does not support the pickling of certain objects, and one of these unsupported objects is a method that is bound to a class instance, also known as an instance method. 

Section 2: What is Pickling?

Before understanding the cause of this error, it's important to understand what pickling is. Pickling is the process of converting a Python object into a bytestream, allowing it to be stored and transmitted more easily. The pickling process involves converting the object's state (i.e., its data) into a format that can be stored, and the pickled object can then be unpickled later to its original state.

Python's pickle module automatically handles the pickling and unpickling process, making it easy to use. However, there are certain types of Python objects that cannot be pickled, and this includes instance methods.

Section 3: How to Solve the Error

The solution to this error message is to modify the code so that it no longer tries to pickle an instance method. One way to do this is by using a combination of instance variables and functions, rather than instance methods.

For example, instead of using an instance method in a class that is being mapped by Pool.map(), you can define a regular function outside of the class and pass in the instance variables as arguments. The function can then be used in place of the instance method during the mapping process.

Another way to solve this error is by using the pathos library, which is a fork of the multiprocessing library that enables more advanced serialization techniques. Pathos provides a more flexible serialization framework and can handle a wider range of Python objects, including instance methods.

Section 4: Conclusion

In conclusion, the "Can't pickle <type 'instancemethod'>" error message is a common issue that occurs when trying to use instance methods with the multiprocessing library's map() function. The solution is to modify the code to avoid using instance methods or to use an alternative library such as Pathos that handles serialization in a more flexible way.
