tldr: In Python, interfaces are implemented by creating classes that contain methods with the same signatures as the methods in the interface.

##### Definition
An interface in Python is a contract between a class and the outside world. It is a structure that enforces certain properties and behaviors on a class that implements it.

##### Syntax
To implement an interface in Python, the class must include the methods and properties defined in the interface. For example, if the interface defines a method called `get_name()`, the implementing class must also define a `get_name()` method.

##### Example
Let's say we have an interface called `Shape` that defines a method called `calculate_area()`. To implement this interface, we would create a class that implements `calculate_area()` as follows:

```python
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius
        
    def calculate_area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2
```

##### Benefits
Interfaces are a powerful tool for ensuring that classes have the necessary properties and behaviors. By defining an interface and having classes implement it, we can be sure that the classes have the methods and properties that we expect them to have. This makes our code more maintainable and easier to understand.
