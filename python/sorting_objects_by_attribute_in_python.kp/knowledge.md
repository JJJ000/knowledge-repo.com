# Section 1: Define the List of Objects

To begin sorting a list of objects based on an attribute of the objects, we must first define the list of objects. This can be done by creating a list of objects that contain the attribute of interest. For example, if we wanted to sort a list of people by their age, we could create a list of Person objects, each with an age attribute.

# Section 2: Create a Sorting Function

Once the list of objects has been defined, the next step is to create a sorting function. This function will take two objects from the list as parameters and compare the attribute of interest. Depending on the comparison, the function should return either a positive or negative number to indicate which object should come first in the sorted list.

# Section 3: Sort the List

Once the sorting function has been created, the list of objects can be sorted using the built-in Python function `sorted()`. This function takes two parameters: the list to be sorted and the sorting function created in the previous step.

# Section 4: Output the Sorted List

Finally, the sorted list can be outputted using the Python `print()` function. This will display the sorted list of objects in the terminal, allowing the user to easily view the sorted list.
