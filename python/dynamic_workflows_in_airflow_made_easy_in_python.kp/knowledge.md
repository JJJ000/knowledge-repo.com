## Introduction
Airflow is an open source tool specifically designed for building, scheduling, and monitoring complex workflows. It has become extremely popular for data engineers, as it can be used to build and schedule data pipelines. In this article, I will discuss the proper way of creating dynamic workflows in Airflow using Python.

## Define the DAG
The first step is to define your Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). A DAG is a collection of tasks that are linked together with dependencies. To create a DAG, you need to import the DAG object from the airflow.models module. Here is an example of defining a DAG:

``` python
from airflow import DAG
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

default_args = {
    'owner': 'airflow',
    'depends_on_past': False,
    'start_date': datetime(2021, 1, 1),
    'retries': 1,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
}

dag = DAG(
    'example_dag',
    default_args=default_args,
    schedule_interval=timedelta(days=1),
)
```

In the above code, we have defined a DAG named 'example_dag'. We have provided some default arguments, which will be applied to all the tasks in the DAG. We have also provided a start date and a schedule interval. This means that the DAG will run every day starting from January 1st, 2021.

## Define the tasks
The next step is to define the tasks that will make up the DAG. Tasks are defined as Python functions, and each function should return a task object. Here is an example of defining a task:

``` python
from airflow.operators.bash_operator import BashOperator
from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator

def task1():
    return BashOperator(
        task_id='task1',
        bash_command='echo "Hello World"',
        dag=dag
    )

def task2():
    return PythonOperator(
        task_id='task2',
        python_callable=my_python_callable_function,
        dag=dag
    )
```

In the above example, we have defined two tasks named 'task1' and 'task2'. 'task1' is a BashOperator that will simply print 'Hello World' to the console. 'task2' is a PythonOperator that will execute a custom Python function named 'my_python_callable_function'.

## Define the dependencies
The final step is to define the dependencies between the tasks. This is done by using the set_downstream() and set_upstream() methods on the task objects. Here is an example:

``` python
task1() >> task2()
```

In the above code, we have defined that 'task1' is upstream of 'task2'. This means that 'task2' cannot be executed until 'task1' has completed successfully. We can also define multiple downstream tasks for a single task:

``` python
task1() >> [task2(), task3()]
```

In the above code, we have defined that 'task1' is upstream of both 'task2' and 'task3'. This means that 'task2' and 'task3' cannot be executed until 'task1' has completed successfully.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, creating dynamic workflows in Airflow involves defining a DAG, defining the tasks, and defining the dependencies between the tasks. By following these steps, you will be able to build, schedule, and monitor complex data pipelines using Airflow.
