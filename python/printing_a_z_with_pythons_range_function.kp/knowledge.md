## Using a for loop

One way to print the range from a to z is by using a for loop. Here's the code:

```python
for letter in range(ord('a'), ord('z')+1):
    print(chr(letter))
```

In this code, we use the `range` function to create a sequence of integers representing the ASCII values of the characters from 'a' to 'z'. Then, we iterate over that sequence using a for loop and print each character using the built-in `chr` function.

## Using a list comprehension

Another way to print the range from a to z is by using a list comprehension. Here's the code:

```python
letters = [chr(letter) for letter in range(ord('a'), ord('z')+1)]
print(' '.join(letters))
```

In this code, we again use the `range` function to create a sequence of integers representing the ASCII values of the characters from 'a' to 'z'. We then use a list comprehension to create a list of characters by applying the `chr` function to each integer in the sequence. Finally, we join the characters in the list using a space as a separator and print the result.

## Using string slicing

Yet another way to print the range from a to z is by using string slicing. Here's the code:

```python
print('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz')
```

In this code, we simply print a string that contains all the characters from 'a' to 'z'. We don't need to use any loops or list comprehensions, but we do need to write out the entire string.

## Using the `string` module

Finally, we can use the `string` module to access a string containing all the lowercase letters. Here's the code:

```python
import string

print(string.ascii_lowercase)
```

In this code, we import the `string` module and access the `ascii_lowercase` attribute, which is a string containing all the lowercase letters from 'a' to 'z'. We simply print that string. Note that this method will not work if you need to print characters other than lowercase letters.
