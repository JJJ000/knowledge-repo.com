### Return

Return is a keyword used in Python to return the result of an expression or a function. It can be used to return a single value or multiple values in the form of a tuple.

### None

None is a special constant in Python that represents the absence of a value or a null value. It is not the same as 0 or an empty string; it is a special constant that has its own datatype NoneType. It is used to indicate that a variable has no value.

### No Return

In Python, functions can also be defined without a return statement. This type of function is called a void function and it does not return any value. Instead, it performs some operations and exits without returning anything.
