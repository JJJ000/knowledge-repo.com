# Introduction

Monkey patching is a dynamic method of modifying the behavior of a class or module at run-time. It is a technique used to extend or modify the runtime code of a program or library without changing the original source code.

# How Monkey Patching Works

Monkey patching works by replacing the existing code of a class or module with new code. This is done by overriding the existing code with a new code. This new code can be written in different languages such as Python, Java, or C++. The new code can also be written in different styles such as object-oriented or functional programming.

# Benefits

Monkey patching is a great way to quickly add new features or fix bugs without having to modify the original source code. It is also a great way to experiment with different approaches and techniques without having to commit to a particular approach or technique.

# Drawbacks

Monkey patching can be difficult to debug and maintain. It can also lead to unexpected behavior and cause conflicts with other parts of the code. Furthermore, monkey patching can lead to code that is difficult to read and understand.
