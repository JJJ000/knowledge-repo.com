tldr: In Python, the type hint for a file or file-like object is `IO` (stands for Input/Output).

## Introduction
In Python, type hints can be used to improve code readability and maintainability by providing information on expected data types. In this case, we want to provide a type hint for a file or file-like object. 

## Using `typing.IO`
One way to provide a type hint for a file or file-like object in Python is to use the `typing.IO` module. This module defines the `IO` class, which can be used to indicate that a variable should be a file-like object.

```python
from typing import IO

def my_function(file_obj: IO) -> None:
    # function code here
```
In this example, `my_function` expects a file or file-like object as `file_obj`. The `None` represents the function's return type.

## Using `typing.TextIO` or `typing.BinaryIO`

Another way to provide a type hint for a file or file-like object in Python is to use the `typing.TextIO` or `typing.BinaryIO` module. These modules define the `TextIO` and `BinaryIO` classes respectively, which can be used to indicate that a variable should be a text or binary file-like object.

```python
from typing import TextIO, BinaryIO

def my_function(text_file: TextIO) -> None:
    # function code here

def my_other_function(binary_file: BinaryIO) -> None:
    # function code here
```

In the first example, `my_function` expects a text file or file-like object as `text_file`. In the second example, `my_other_function` expects a binary file or file-like object as `binary_file`.

## Conclusion
Providing type hints for file or file-like objects in Python can help to improve code readability and maintainability. By using `typing.IO`, `typing.TextIO`, or `typing.BinaryIO`, we can clearly indicate that a variable is expected to be a file or file-like object.
