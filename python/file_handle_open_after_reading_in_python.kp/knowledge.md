tldr: No, reading an entire file in Python will automatically close the file handle.

1. Overview

Reading an entire file in Python does not necessarily leave the file handle open. The file handle will remain open if the file is opened in read-only mode, but will be closed if the file is opened in read-write mode.

2. Read-Only Mode

When a file is opened in read-only mode, the file handle will remain open after the entire file has been read. This is because the file is not being modified, and the file handle is still needed to access the file.

3. Read-Write Mode

When a file is opened in read-write mode, the file handle will be closed after the entire file has been read. This is because the file is being modified, and the file handle is no longer needed to access the file.

4. Conclusion

In conclusion, whether or not a file handle remains open after reading an entire file in Python depends on the mode in which the file was opened. If the file was opened in read-only mode, the file handle will remain open. If the file was opened in read-write mode, the file handle will be closed.
