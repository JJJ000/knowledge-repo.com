Section 1: Introduction to SQLAlchemy
SQLAlchemy is a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) that supports several popular SQL databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite. It is written in Python and provides a convenient way to interact with relational databases.

Section 2: Introduction to using OR in SQLAlchemy
In SQLAlchemy, OR is used to compose logical expressions that allow querying out complex data. OR is used when we want to retrieve records that meet at least one of several conditions. OR is used in conjunction with AND, NOT, and parenthesis to compose more complex expressions.

Section 3: Syntax of using OR in SQLAlchemy
To use OR in SQLAlchemy, we can use the or_() method provided by the sqlalchemy.sql.expression module. The or_() method takes two or more logical expressions as arguments and returns a new logical expression representing the combination of these expressions.

Here is an example of using OR in SQLAlchemy to query records from a hypothetical User table:

```python
from sqlalchemy import create_engine, Table, Column, Integer, String, MetaData, or_

engine = create_engine('mysql://user:password@localhost/db_name')
metadata = MetaData()

users = Table('users', metadata,
    Column('id', Integer, primary_key=True),
    Column('name', String),
    Column('email', String)
)

# Select users with name 'John' or email containing 'example.com'
query = users.select().where(or_(users.c.name == 'John', users.c.email.like('%example.com')))
```

In this example, we first create a connection to a MySQL database using the create_engine() method. We define a User table and create a query to select records that satisfy the condition that the name is 'John' or the email contains 'example.com'. The or_() method is used to combine these two conditions.

Section 4: Conclusion
In conclusion, OR is a useful tool that can be used in conjunction with AND and NOT to compose complex logical expressions for querying data in SQLAlchemy. The or_() method provided by the sqlalchemy.sql.expression module can be used to create logical expressions that represent the OR operation.
