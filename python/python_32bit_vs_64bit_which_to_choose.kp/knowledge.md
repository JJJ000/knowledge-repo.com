tldr: It depends on whether your operating system is 32-bit or 64-bit.

## Compatibility 

If your computer operating system is a 64bit, it is generally better to use Python 64bit because it is compatible with modern 64bit operating systems that have a higher processing power. However, if you have a 32bit operating system, you will have to stick to using Python 32bit because it might not work well or even install on a 64bit operating system. 

## Memory Requirements 

Your choice between Python 32bit and Python 64bit is dependent on the memory resources of your system. If you have a good memory configuration (8GB RAM or more), then you can use Python 64bit version. Why? Python 64bit uses a larger memory register to store longer integer values as compared to the 32bit version, leading to better performance. Python 32bit, on the other hand, is suited for machines with limited memory because it takes up less memory space. 

## Library and Support

Another factor to consider before choosing between Python 32bit and Python 64-bit is the library and support available for each version. Python 64bit has a more robust library support with the availability of the latest and up-to-date libraries that can assist in your code optimization. On the other hand, Python 32bit still has limited support for some libraries, so you might face issues with some applications when working with Python 32bit version.

## Performance

Performance is another factor you should consider when choosing between Python 32bit and Python 64-bit. If you are working with large datasets or running resource-intensive applications that require a lot of processing power or make use of multi-core processors or threading, then you should consider using Python 64bit. Python 64bit has the ability to use larger memory space, leading to faster computing speed and better performance. 

In conclusion, the choice between Python 32bit and Python 64-bit depends on your specific needs and circumstances, and no one solution fits all problems.
