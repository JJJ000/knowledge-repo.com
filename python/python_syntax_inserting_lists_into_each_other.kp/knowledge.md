tldr: The syntax to insert one list into another list in Python is list1.extend(list2).

## Creating Two Lists

To insert one list into another list in Python, we need to create two lists first. Let's use the following syntax to create two lists:

```
list1 = [1, 2, 3]
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
```

## Using the extend() Method

We can use the `extend()` method to insert one list into another list. The `extend()` method adds all the elements of one list to the end of another list. Here's how we can use it to insert `list2` into `list1`:

```
list1.extend(list2)
```

After executing this statement, `list1` will contain the elements `[1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c']`.

## Using the + Operator

Another way to insert one list into another list is to use the `+` operator. The `+` operator concatenates two lists and returns a new list. Here's how we can use it to insert `list2` into `list1`:

```
new_list = list1 + list2
```

After executing this statement, `new_list` will contain the elements `[1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c']`. We can assign this new list to `list1` if we want to replace the original `list1` with the new list.

## Using Slicing and Concatenation

Finally, we can also insert one list into another list using slicing and concatenation. Here's how we can use this method to insert `list2` into `list1`:

```
list1[len(list1):] = list2
```

After executing this statement, `list1` will contain the elements `[1, 2, 3, 'a', 'b', 'c']`. 

Note that we used `len(list1)` as the starting index of the slice, which ensures that the new elements are added to the end of `list1`.
