Introduction
------------
In Python, we use format strings to interpolate variables or values into a string by using placeholders that are replaced with their respective values during runtime. One of the commonly used placeholders in Python format strings is `%s`. In this article, we will explore what `%s` means and how to use it in Python.

What is %s?
------------
In a Python format string, `%s` is a placeholder that is used to represent a string value. When the string is formatted, the `%s` placeholder gets replaced with the value of the corresponding variable or expression that is passed to the format method.

For example, consider the following code snippet:

```
name = "John"
age = 25
print("My name is %s and I am %d years old." % (name, age))
```

In the above code, we have a format string that contains two placeholders: `%s` and `%d`. The `%s` placeholder is used to represent the name variable, which contains a string value. The `%d` placeholder is used to represent the age variable, which contains an integer value.

How to use %s?
--------------
To use the `%s` placeholder in a Python format string, we simply add it to the string and pass the variables or expressions that we want to interpolate to the format method as arguments.

For example, consider the following code snippet:

```
name = "John"
age = 25
print("My name is %s and I am %d years old." % (name, age))
```

In the above code, we have a format string that contains two placeholders: `%s` and `%d`. We pass the variables `name` and `age` as arguments to the format method, in the order that they appear in the format string. The result of this code will be:

```
My name is John and I am 25 years old.
```

Conclusion
----------
In conclusion, `%s` is a placeholder that is used in Python format strings to represent a string value. It is one of the most commonly used placeholders in Python, and is used to interpolate variables or expressions into a string. By understanding how to use `%s`, we can write more effective Python code that is easier to read and maintain.
