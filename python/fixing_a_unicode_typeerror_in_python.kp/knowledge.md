# Step 1: Encoding the Unicode Object

The first step to correcting the TypeError is to encode the Unicode object. Python has several different encoding methods available, such as UTF-8, ASCII, and Latin-1. The specific encoding method used depends on the type of data being encoded.

# Step 2: Hashing the Encoded Data

Once the Unicode object has been encoded, the next step is to hash the encoded data. Python provides several hashing algorithms, such as SHA-256, SHA-512, and MD5. The specific algorithm used depends on the type of data being hashed.

# Step 3: Verifying the Hash

The final step is to verify the hash. This can be done by comparing the generated hash with a known hash for the same data. If the hashes match, then the data is valid.

# Step 4: Storing the Hash

Once the hash has been verified, it should be stored in a secure location. This will ensure that the data can be verified in the future.
