tldr: Possible answer The environment variables and paths used by pytest may differ from those used by the Python interpreter.

## Introduction

Pytest is a popular testing framework used for writing unit tests in Python. It helps developers to write automated tests and make sure that their code is working as expected. However, sometimes pytest cannot import a module while Python can. In this article, we will explore some of the possible reasons for this issue and how to fix them.

## Possible reasons

There can be multiple reasons why pytest cannot import a module while Python can. Some of the common reasons are:

### 1. Incorrect module path

One of the primary reasons why pytest cannot import a module while Python can is the incorrect module path. Python's import statement searches for a module in different locations based on the PYTHONPATH environment variable, sys.path, and various site-packages directories. However, pytest may use a different mechanism to resolve the import path, which can lead to unexpected errors.

### 2. Missing dependency

Another reason why pytest cannot import a module while Python can is the missing dependency. For example, if a module depends on another module(s) that pytest cannot find or import, then it may result in an import error.

### 3. Circular dependency

Circular dependency occurs when two or more modules depend on each other. It can cause import errors as the modules cannot resolve their dependencies.

### 4. Different Python version

Sometimes, pytest and Python can use different Python versions. For example, you may have multiple Python versions installed on your system, and the pytest and Python may be using different versions. As a result, pytest may not be able to import a module that Python can.

## Solutions

Depending on the cause of the issue, there can be different solutions to the problem. Here are some common solutions:

### 1. Fix the import path

If pytest cannot import a module due to an incorrect import path, you can fix it by adding the correct path to PYTHONPATH environment variable or sys.path.

### 2. Install missing dependencies

If pytest cannot import a module due to missing dependencies, you can install the missing dependencies using pip or conda.

### 3. Fix circular dependencies

If the import error is due to circular dependencies, you can refactor your code to remove the circular dependencies or use lazy imports.

### 4. Use the same Python version

If pytest and Python are using different versions, you can use a virtual environment to isolate the Python versions and use the same Python version for both pytest and Python.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, pytest may sometimes not import the module while Python can due to different reasons such as incorrect import path, missing dependencies, circular dependencies, and different Python versions. By understanding the root cause of the problem, you can fix it using the appropriate solution.
