1. Overview
---------------
PyCharm is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python development. It provides a variety of features to help developers write and debug code. One of these features is the ability to detect unresolved references or errors in code. This feature can be useful in ensuring that code is syntactically correct and that all references are valid.

2. How PyCharm Detects Unresolved References
--------------------------------------------
PyCharm uses a combination of static and dynamic analysis to detect unresolved references. Static analysis involves analyzing the code for any potential errors or references that may not be valid. Dynamic analysis involves running the code and checking for any errors that may occur.

3. When PyCharm Shows Unresolved References Error
--------------------------------------------------
PyCharm may show an unresolved references error if the code contains a reference to a variable, function, or class that is not defined. This can happen if the reference is misspelled, if the reference is not imported, or if the reference is not defined in the same scope.

4. Fixing Unresolved References Errors
--------------------------------------
The best way to fix an unresolved references error is to ensure that all references are valid. This can be done by checking the spelling of the reference, ensuring that the reference is imported, and ensuring that the reference is defined in the same scope. Additionally, it can be helpful to use a linter or static analysis tool to detect any potential errors.
