[TOC]

Section 1: Identify the long line

It's important to first identify which line of code is too long. Look for a line that goes beyond the recommended character limit of 79 characters per line in Python.

For example:
```
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100]
```

Section 2: Split the code into multiple lines using parentheses

One way to break up a long line is by using parentheses to split the code into multiple lines. Make sure to indent the continuation lines to make it clear they are part of the same code block.

For example:
```
my_list = [
    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
    21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38,
    39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56,
    57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74,
    75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92,
    93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100
]
```

Section 3: Use the backslash character to indicate line continuation

Another way to break up a long line is by using the backslash character (\) to indicate that the line continues on the next line. Again, make sure to indent the continuation lines so it's clear they are part of the same code block.

For example:
```
my_list = \
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,
     21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38,
     39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56,
     57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74,
     75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92,
     93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100]
```

Section 4: Use a loop or list comprehension to generate the long line

If the long line is caused by a large list, consider using a loop or list comprehension to generate the list and avoid the need for a long line.

For example:
```
my_list = [i for i in range(1, 101)]
```

This generates a list of integers from 1 to 100 without the need for a long line.
