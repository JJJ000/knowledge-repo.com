tldr: Use the `join` method to combine the strings in the list into a single string, separating each element with a comma.

##### Using a For Loop

The following example uses a for loop to loop through a list of strings, and adds a comma and space between each string before adding it to a new string.

```python
list_of_strings = ["one", "two", "three", "four"]

comma_separated_string = ""

for i in range(len(list_of_strings)):
    comma_separated_string += list_of_strings[i]
    if i < len(list_of_strings) - 1:
        comma_separated_string += ", "

print(comma_separated_string) # prints "one, two, three, four"
```

##### Using the Join Method

The join method can be used to join the elements of a list into a string, with each element separated by the specified separator.

```python
list_of_strings = ["one", "two", "three", "four"]

comma_separated_string = ", ".join(list_of_strings)

print(comma_separated_string) # prints "one, two, three, four"
```

##### Using List Comprehension

List comprehension can also be used to create a comma-separated string from a list of strings.

```python
list_of_strings = ["one", "two", "three", "four"]

comma_separated_string = ", ".join([str(x) for x in list_of_strings])

print(comma_separated_string) # prints "one, two, three, four"
```
