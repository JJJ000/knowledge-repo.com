# What is an IndentationError?
An IndentationError is an error raised when Python encounters code that is not properly indented. This error is caused when the code is not properly aligned with the indentation level of the outer code.

# What Causes an IndentationError?
An IndentationError is caused when the code is not properly indented. This is often caused when the indentation level of the code is different from the outer code. For example, if the outer code has an indentation level of four spaces, then any code inside the outer code must also have an indentation level of four spaces.

# How to Fix an IndentationError
The best way to fix an IndentationError is to ensure that all code is properly indented. This means that the indentation level of the code should match the level of the outer code. Additionally, it is important to ensure that all lines of code are properly indented. This can be done by using a text editor or an IDE with an auto-indentation feature.

# Conclusion
IndentationError is an error raised when Python encounters code that is not properly indented. This error is caused when the code is not properly aligned with the indentation level of the outer code. The best way to fix an IndentationError is to ensure that all code is properly indented and all lines of code are properly indented.
