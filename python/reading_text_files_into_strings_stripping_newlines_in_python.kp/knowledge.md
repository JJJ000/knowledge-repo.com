tldr: Use the read() method of the open file object to read the contents of the file into a string variable, then use the replace() method to strip newlines.

### Using the `read()` Method

The `read()` method can be used to read a file and store it as a string. This method takes in the number of characters to read as an argument, and if no argument is provided, it will read the entire file into a string.

```python
# Open the file
f = open('file.txt', 'r')

# Read the entire file into a string
data = f.read()

# Close the file
f.close()
```

### Stripping Newlines

To remove newline characters from the string, the `rstrip()` method can be used. This method takes a character or a set of characters to remove from the end of the string. To remove all newline characters, `'\n'` can be passed as an argument.

```python
# Strip newline characters from the string
data = data.rstrip('\n')
```

### Putting it All Together

The two steps can be combined into a single statement using the `with` statement. This statement will open the file, read it into a string, and then strip all newline characters from the string.

```python
# Open the file and read it into a string, stripping newlines
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    data = f.read().rstrip('\n')
```
