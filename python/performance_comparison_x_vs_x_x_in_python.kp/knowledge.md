tldr: Checking if an element exists in a tuple with the `in` operator is faster than checking for equality because tuples are optimized for membership testing.

1. Background
In Python, string comparisons can be performed using the `==` operator. However, there are instances where this approach can be inefficient, leading to slower execution times. One alternative is to use tuple membership testing instead, which involves checking if an item is present in a tuple. 

2. Tuple membership testing
Tuple membership testing involves using the `in` operator to check whether a particular item is present in a tuple. For example, `(1,2,3)` contains the value `2` and therefore `2 in (1,2,3)` would return `True`. 

3. Why is tuple membership testing faster?
There are a few reasons why tuple membership testing can be faster than using `==` to compare strings. Firstly, tuples are immutable, meaning that once created, their value cannot be changed. This means that membership testing can be performed more efficiently than with mutable objects like strings, which may require additional operations to check for equality. Additionally, tuples are implemented as arrays in memory, which enables faster indexing and retrieval of values. 

4. Conclusion
In conclusion, using tuple membership testing can be faster than using `==` to compare strings. This is due to the efficiency of tuple membership testing and the fact that tuples are implemented as arrays in memory, allowing for faster indexing and retrieval of values.
