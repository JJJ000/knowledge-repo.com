tldr: The input data needs to be converted to bytes using the encode method before it can be written to a file or passed to a function that requires bytes instead of Unicode strings.

Section 1: Explanation of the Error Message
When we use CSV module in python, we often experience the error message TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str' which usually occurs when the CSV file we are trying to read or write is encoded in some format rather than a byte string, but our program treats it as a unicode string. 

Section 2: Solution to the Error Message
To get rid of this error message, we can either decode the CSV file and convert it to a Unicode string or we can open the CSV file in binary mode. This will ensure that the CSV file is treated as a byte string and the error message will be resolved.

Section 3: An Example Illustrating the Solution 
Let us consider the following code that attempts to read the contents of a CSV file using the CSV module:

import csv
with open('example.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)

This code will produce the error message TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str'. To fix this error message, we can use the binary mode to open the CSV file. Here is the modified code:

import csv
with open('example.csv', 'rb') as file: # opened in binary mode
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)

Now the code will read the contents of the CSV file without any issues.

Section 4: Conclusion
In conclusion, the error message TypeError: a bytes-like object is required, not 'str' usually occurs when the CSV file we are trying to read or write is encoded in some format rather than a byte string, but our program treats it as a unicode string. We can resolve the error message by either decoding the CSV file and converting it to a Unicode string or by opening the CSV file in binary mode.
