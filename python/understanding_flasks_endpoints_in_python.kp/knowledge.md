Introduction
Flask is a web framework for building web applications in Python. It is a highly used framework in web development with Python. Flask provides various functionalities to develop web applications, such as routing, rendering templates, and handling requests. In Flask framework, an endpoint is an essential component that handles HTTP requests made to the application. In this article, we will discuss what an endpoint is in Flask and its importance in the Flask application.

What is an Endpoint?
An endpoint is a specific URL of a web application that gets mapped to a particular function. This function is responsible for handling an HTTP request and providing an appropriate response. In Flask, the endpoint is defined using the `@app.route()` decorator. This decorator maps the URL to a function in the Flask application.

Example:
```
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```
In this example, the `/` URL maps to the `hello_world` function, which returns 'Hello, World!' This function will be executed whenever a user requests the root URL.

Importance of Endpoint:
Endpoints are essential to handle requests to different parts of a Flask application. Flask endpoints allow you to define the mappings between the URL and the corresponding function. Flask endpoints can also be used to receive and execute API requests, and create RESTful services.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, an endpoint is a URL of a Flask web application that maps to a specific function. Flask endpoints are essential components of the web application and greatly assist a Flask application in handling requests.
