## Using pip

Once 'pip' is installed, it can be used to install and manage Python packages. This can be done by running the 'pip install' command followed by the name of the package to be installed. For example, to install the 'requests' package, the command would be 'pip install requests'.

## Conclusion

In order to use 'pip' in Python, it must first be installed. Once installed, it can be used to install and manage Python packages. This makes it a useful tool for managing Python packages and ensuring that the correct versions are used.
