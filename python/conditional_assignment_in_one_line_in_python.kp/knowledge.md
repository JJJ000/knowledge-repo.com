1. What are one line if-condition-assignments?
One line if-condition-assignments are a shorthand method of assigning a value to a variable based on a condition. It can be used to simplify code and make it easier to read by reducing the number of lines required to express the same logic.

2. How to write one line if-condition-assignments in Python?
The syntax of a one line if-condition-assignment in Python is as follows: `variable = value_if_true if condition else value_if_false`. This statement evaluates the `condition` and assigns `value_if_true` to `variable` if it is true, otherwise it assigns `value_if_false` to `variable`.

3. Examples of one line if-condition-assignments in Python:
For example, to assign a value of 1 to `x` if `a` is greater than `b` and 0 otherwise, we could use the following code: `x = 1 if a > b else 0`.

Another example could be to assign the string "even" if a number `num` is even and "odd" otherwise: `result = "even" if num % 2 == 0 else "odd"`. 

4. Advantages and disadvantages of one line if-condition-assignments:
One line if-condition-assignments can make code more concise and readable, but if they become too complex or nested, they can become difficult to read and may decrease readability. It is important to use them judiciously and appropriately for each situation.
