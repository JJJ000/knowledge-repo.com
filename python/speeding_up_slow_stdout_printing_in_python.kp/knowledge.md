tldr: Printing to stdout is slow because it involves a lot of overhead operations, but it can be sped up by using buffering or a more efficient approach like writing to a file or using a third-party library such as tqdm.

Introduction
Printing to stdout can be slow due to several factors. In Python, there are ways to speed up the process and improve the overall performance. This article explores the reasons why printing to stdout is slow and how it can be sped up in Python.

Reasons for Slowness
There are several reasons why printing to stdout can be slow:

1. I/O Overhead: Writing data to an I/O device, like stdout, involves overhead - the time required to prepare and format data for output. This overhead can create a bottleneck, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.

2. Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL): Python uses a GIL to ensure that only one thread can execute Python code at a time. This means that when multiple threads try to print to stdout simultaneously, they might have to wait for the GIL to be released, resulting in slower performance.

3. Buffering: stdout is often buffered, meaning that output data is temporarily stored in a buffer before it is written to the I/O device. This can impact performance, particularly when printing small amounts of data frequently.

Ways to Speed Up Printing to stdout
Here are some ways to speed up printing to stdout in Python:

1. Use sys.stdout.write() instead of print(): Using sys.stdout.write() can be faster than print() since it avoids the overhead of constructing a string to pass to print(). This can be particularly beneficial when printing large amounts of data.

2. Use the logging module: The logging module is designed to handle logging and outputting messages to stdout or other I/O devices effectively. Using this module can reduce the overhead of formatting messages and improve runtime performance.

3. Turn off buffering: Turning off buffering can improve the performance of printing to stdout. This can be achieved by setting the environment variable PYTHONUNBUFFERED to a non-empty string, which will disable output buffering.

4. Use threading or multiprocessing: To improve performance when dealing with multiple threads simultaneously printing to stdout, consider using threading or multiprocessing. Since each thread or process has its own GIL, you can take advantage of multiple cores to speed up printing.

Conclusion
Printing to stdout can be slow due to I/O overheads, Python's GIL, and buffering. To speed up printing in Python, consider using sys.stdout.write(), the logging module, turning off buffering, or using threading or multiprocessing. By implementing these techniques, you can reduce the time spent on printing and improve the overall performance of your Python code.
