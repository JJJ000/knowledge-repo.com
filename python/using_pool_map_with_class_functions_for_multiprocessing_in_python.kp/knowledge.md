Section 1: Introduction
Python is a versatile programming language that supports multiprocessing to enhance performance on tasks that require a huge amount of computations. A multiprocess is an approach where multiple processes execute at the same time, sharing a single machine's resources, which leads to faster execution and resource utilization. One of the most popular methods in Python for multiprocessing is the Pool.map function, which applies a given function to a set of arguments, returning a list of the function's result applied to the arguments.

Section 2: Defining a Function in a Class
When defining a function in a class, it becomes an instance method, which requires an instance of the class to call the function. To define a function in a class, you must use the `def` keyword followed by the method's name and arguments, as shown below:

```
class ExampleClass:
    def example_method(self, arg1, arg2):
        # Function code here
```

The `self` parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class and is required in all instance methods. You can include any number of parameters in the method definition, depending on the implementation's needs.

Section 3: Multiprocessing with Pool.map on a Function Defined in a Class
To use `Pool.map` on a function defined in a class, you need to create an instance of the class containing the function you want to apply `Pool.map` to. The first argument passed to `Pool.map` is the function to apply, followed by a sequence of arguments to pass to the function. The code below shows how to use `Pool.map` on a function defined in a class:

```
from multiprocessing import Pool

class ExampleClass:
    def example_method(self, arg1, arg2):
        # Function code here

if __name__ == '__main__':
    example_instance = ExampleClass()
    args = [(1,2), (3,4), (5,6)] # List of argument tuples
    
    with Pool(4) as pool:
        results = pool.starmap(example_instance.example_method, args)
        
    print(results)
```

In the code above, we create an instance of `ExampleClass` called `example_instance`. We then create a list of argument tuples called `args` that we want to pass to `example_instance.example_method`. We use the `Pool` function to create a pool of 4 worker processes, and we pass `example_instance.example_method` and `args` to the `starmap` method to execute the function on the arguments. Finally, we print the result of `starmap`.

Section 4: Conclusion
In summary, using `Pool.map` on a function defined in a class in Python requires creating an instance of the class containing the function, passing the instance and a sequence of arguments to `Pool.map`, and executing the function on the arguments. The `Pool.map` function is a powerful tool for increasing the performance of Python applications that require intensive computations or operate on large datasets.
