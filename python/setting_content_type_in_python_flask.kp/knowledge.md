# Setting Content Type in Flask

Flask is a micro web framework in Python that allows developers to build web applications quickly and easily. One important aspect of building web applications is managing content types, which determines how the data is interpreted and rendered by the server and the client's browser. Here are a few ways to set content type in Flask.

## Importing Flask Library

Before setting up the content type, Flask needs to be imported into the Python environment using the following code snippet:

```
from flask import Flask, request, Response
app = Flask(__name__)
```

## Setting Up Content Type in Response Headers

Setting the content type in the response headers ensures that the client's browser interprets the data correctly. The following code sets the content type to `text/html`:

```
@app.route("/")
def index():
    return Response("<h1>Hello, World!</h1>", content_type='text/html')
```

## Setting Up Content Type for Forms

When handling HTML form input data, it is necessary to set the content type to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. This ensures that the server interprets and processes the form data correctly. The following code snippet sets the content type for an HTML form:

```
@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    username = request.form['username']
    password = request.form['password']
    # Do some processing here
    return Response(status=200, content_type='application/x-www-form-urlencoded')
```

## Setting Up Content Type for JSON Data

JSON is a popular data format used in web applications. Setting up the content type of JSON responses is necessary to ensure that the client's browser interprets the data correctly. The following code sets the content type to `application/json`:

```
@app.route('/jsondata')
def jsonResponse():
    data = {"name" : "Bob", "age": 30}
    return Response(json.dumps(data), content_type='application/json')
```

## Conclusion

In summary, Flask provides several ways to set up content type. These include setting the content type in the response headers, setting up content type for HTML forms and JSON data. Once you have set up the content type, the client's browser can interpret the data correctly, making for a robust web application.
