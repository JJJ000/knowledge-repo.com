## Introduction
Python compiles source code files into **.pyc** files to improve the efficiency of execution. However, these files can sometimes cause issues, such as conflicts between different versions of the same code. In this tutorial, we will look at how to avoid creating .pyc files in Python.


## Method 1: Using the -B Flag
The first method to avoid .pyc files is to use the **-B** flag when running Python. This flag tells Python not to generate .pyc files, even if it would normally do so. This can be done by running the following command:

```
python -B your_script.py
```

Using this flag will prevent Python from creating .pyc files for the current script.

## Method 2: Setting the PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE Environment Variable
The second method to avoid .pyc files is to set the **PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE** environment variable. This variable tells Python not to generate .pyc files for any script, even if the -B flag is not used. This can be set with the following command:

```
export PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
```

Or, if you're on Windows, use this command:

```
set PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
```

Setting this environment variable will prevent Python from creating .pyc files for any script you run while the variable is set. 

## Method 3: Deleting .pyc Files
The third method to avoid .pyc files is to delete them after they are created. This can be done by running the following command:

```
find . -name "*.pyc" -exec rm -f {} \;
```

This command finds all .pyc files in the current directory and its subdirectories and removes them. You can run this command periodically to remove any .pyc files that may have been generated.


## Conclusion
There are several ways to avoid .pyc files in Python, including running Python with the -B flag, setting the PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE environment variable, and deleting .pyc files after they are created. These methods can help prevent conflicts and other issues caused by .pyc files.
