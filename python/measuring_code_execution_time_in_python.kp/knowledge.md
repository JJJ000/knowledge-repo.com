# Introduction
Measuring the time taken between lines of code is a useful way to identify bottlenecks in your code and optimize its performance. In Python, there are several ways to measure execution time, depending on your requirements and the level of detail you need.

# Option 1: Using the time module
One simple way to measure execution time between lines of code is to use the time module's `time()` function. You can use this method to measure the time taken between two lines of code by calling `time()` before and after the code you want to measure and calculating the difference.

```python
import time

start = time.time()

# code to measure execution time

end = time.time()

print('Execution time:', end - start)
```

# Option 2: Using the timeit module
The `timeit` module provides a more powerful and accurate way to measure execution time in Python. This module executes the code multiple times and calculates the average execution time to give a more accurate result.

```python
import timeit

code_to_measure = """
# code to measure execution time
"""

result = timeit.timeit(stmt=code_to_measure, number=10000)
print('Execution time:', result)
```

In this example, we pass the code we want to measure as a string to the `timeit.timeit()` function using the `stmt` parameter. We also pass the number of times we want to execute the code using the `number` parameter.

# Option 3: Using a profiling tool
Profiling tools such as `cProfile` and `pyinstrument` provide a more detailed analysis of the execution time of your Python code. These tools can help you identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your code for better performance.

```python
import cProfile

def code_to_measure():
    # code to measure execution time

cProfile.run('code_to_measure()', sort='time')
```

In this example, we use the `cProfile.run()` function to execute and profile the `code_to_measure()` function. We pass a `sort` parameter to sort the results by the time taken to execute each function. The output will show the number of calls, total time, and time per call for each function.
