tldr: Use the built-in function `next()` with a default value to return the last item of the iterator `next(iter, None)` where `iter` is the iterator object.

1. Introduction
Iterators are commonly used in Python programming to manage the memory and processing requirements of large amounts of data. They allow you to process data one element at a time, rather than holding all the data in memory at once. In some cases, you may need to get the last item from an iterator. However, Python iterators do not support indexing or counting, making it difficult to retrieve the last item. In this tutorial, we will explore several methods to get the last item from a Python iterator.

2. Method 1: Using the collections.deque() function
One way to get the last item from an iterator is to use the collections.deque() function. This function creates a double-ended queue, which is like a list but with faster appends and pops from both ends. You can easily convert an iterator to a deque using the deque() function, and then pop the last item from the deque using pop() method. 

```python
import collections

def last_item(iterator):
    # Convert Iterator to Deque
    deque = collections.deque(iterator)
    # Pop the Last Item
    return deque.pop()

```

3. Method 2: Using a Loop
Another method to get the last item from a Python iterator is to use a loop to iterate through the iterator until the last item is reached. This method does not require the use of any external modules, making it more lightweight.

```python
def last_item(iterator):
    # Initialize variable to store last item
    last = None
    # Loop through iterator
    for item in iterator:
        last = item
    # Return last item
    return last
```

4. Method 3: Using the itertools module
Finally, we can also use the itertools module to get the last item from a Python iterator. The itertools module provides a function called tee() that allows you to create multiple iterators from a single iterator. Once you have created two iterators, you can use one iterator to iterate through the elements until the second-to-last element, and then return the next element from the other iterator, which will be the last item.

```python
import itertools

def last_item(iterator):
    # Create two iterators from the original
    a, b = itertools.tee(iterator)
    # Advance the first iterator to the second-to-last item
    next(b, None)
    # Return the next item from the second iterator
    return next(b, None)
```

Conclusion
In this tutorial, we explored three methods to get the last item from a Python iterator. We can use the collections.deque() function, a loop, or the itertools module. Each method has its pros and cons, depending on your needs. When dealing with large amounts of data, the collections.deque() method may be faster due to its optimized append and pop operations. However, if you are looking for a more lightweight solution or don't want to import external modules, the loop method or itertools method may be better suited for your needs.
