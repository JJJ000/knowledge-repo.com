tldr: functools.partial is necessary because it allows for partial function application, which enables currying and provides a convenient way to create specialized versions of a function with predetermined arguments.

Introduction 
Python is an extremely popular language in modern software development. It has a wide range of features that make it a very powerful and flexible language. One of these features is functools.partial. The functools module in Python provides various functions to manipulate functions and execution sequences. functools.partial is one such function that allows us to create a new function by fixing some of the argument values in an existing function. In this article, we will discuss why functools.partial is necessary in python. 

Section 1: Flexibility in Function Design
When we design a function, we want it to be as flexible as possible. We want it to work in different contexts and with different inputs. However, sometimes, we may want to create a new function based on an existing one that works only for a specific use case. For example, we may have a function that calculates the distance between two points given their coordinates. Suppose we have a specific use case where we know one of the coordinates is always zero. In that case, instead of modifying the existing function to handle this case, we can create a new function that always takes a zero coordinate as input using functools.partial. 

Section 2: Reducing Code Duplication 
Suppose we have a function that takes multiple arguments, and we need to call this function many times with the same set of arguments. Instead of duplicating the set of arguments every time, we can use functools.partial to create a new function with the arguments fixed. This reduces code duplication and makes our code more concise and readable. 

Section 3: Delayed Execution 
In some cases, we may want to delay the execution of a function until a later time. functools.partial can be used to create a new function that has some of the arguments preset. This new function can be passed around like a regular function and executed later. Delayed execution can be useful when dealing with complex workflows where different functions need to be executed at different times. 

Conclusion 
In summary, functools.partial is a powerful feature of Python that allows us to create new functions by fixing some of the arguments in an existing function. This feature provides flexibility in function design, reduces code duplication, and enables delayed execution. These features make Python a more powerful and versatile language for programming.
