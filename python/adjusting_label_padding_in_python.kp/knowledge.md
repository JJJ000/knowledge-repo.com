tldr: You can adjust padding with cutoff or overlapping labels in Python by setting the labelpad parameter of the axes object.

[TOC]

#### Section 1 - Adjusting Padding

Padding can be adjusted in Python by using the `pad` function. This function takes in a number of arguments, such as the length of the padding, the type of padding (e.g. left, right, top, bottom), and the character to use for the padding. For example, to add 10 characters of padding to the left side of a string, you would use the following code: 

```python
padded_string = "some string".pad(10, side="left")
```

#### Section 2 - Cutoff Labels

Cutoff labels can be adjusted in Python by using the `slice` function. This function takes in two arguments: the starting index of the slice and the ending index of the slice. For example, to slice a string from the 5th character to the 10th character, you would use the following code: 

```python
sliced_string = "some string"[5:10]
```

#### Section 3 - Overlapping Labels

Overlapping labels can be adjusted in Python by using the `replace` function. This function takes in two arguments: the substring to be replaced and the substring to replace it with. For example, to replace the substring "foo" with the substring "bar" in a string, you would use the following code: 

```python
replaced_string = "some string".replace("foo", "bar")
```

#### Section 4 - Combining Functions

The various functions described above can be combined to adjust padding, cutoff labels, and overlapping labels in Python. For example, to add 10 characters of padding to the left side of a string and replace the substring "foo" with the substring "bar", you would use the following code: 

```python
adjusted_string = "some string".pad(10, side="left").replace("foo", "bar")
```
