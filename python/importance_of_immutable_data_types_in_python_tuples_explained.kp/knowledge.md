tldr: Tuples are needed in Python (or any immutable data type) to store and pass around data that should not be modified or changed accidentally.

## Introduction

In Python, there are two types of data types, mutable and immutable, where mutable data types can be modified after it is created. In contrast, immutable data types, once created, cannot be changed or modified. Tuples are a type of immutable data type in Python. In this article, we will discuss why tuples are an essential part of Python programming, and how they can be used. 

## Immutability 

Tuples are immutable because they cannot be modified once they are created. This essentially means that we can't add, remove or change any of the elements of a tuple. By making a variable or object immutable, we ensure that once its state is set, it can't change from external factors or code. Immutability provides a variety of benefits such as:

- Tuples are hashable, making them suitable for use as keys in dictionaries or for storage in sets.
- Immutable data types are safer to use in multi-threaded environments. In Python, we can significantly reduce the complexity of our code by using immutable data types. 

## Performance 

Python's tuples are created faster than lists since they have a fixed size and structure. As a result, tuples are more memory-efficient than lists since they do not generate buffer overflows. Hence, tuples are a good choice if you have a large amount of data and want to optimize your program performance.  

## Easy to use 

One of the significant advantages of tuples is their simplicity. In Python programming, tuples are usually created by placing a list of elements separated by commas inside parentheses. Tuples are simple to iterate, making them an excellent choice for many programming operations.

In conclusion, tuples are a fundamental part of Python programming, and they offer several benefits over mutable data types. Their immutability makes them safer to use in multi-threaded environments, improves program performance, and is easy to use.
