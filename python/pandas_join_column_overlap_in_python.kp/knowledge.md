# Problem 

When joining two Pandas DataFrames, if the columns overlap and no suffix is specified, it leads to a value error.

```
ValueError: columns overlap but no suffix specified: Index(['column_name'], dtype='object')
```

# Solution 

There are multiple ways to solve this problem. Some of them are mentioned below.

## 1. Specify `suffixes` parameter in the `join` method.

If the columns in the DataFrames have overlapping column names, we can use the `suffixes` parameter to specify a string to be appended to the column names that overlap during the join.

``` python
df1.join(df2, lsuffix='_l', rsuffix='_r')
```
This will add `_l` to all the common column names in the left DataFrame and `_r` to all common column names in the right DataFrame. This will avoid the overlap in common column names.

## 2. Use `merge` method instead of `join` method

Another way to join two DataFrames is by using the `merge` method. This method is more flexible than `join` and provides more control over the join operation.

``` python
pd.merge(df1, df2, on='column_name')
```

In this method, we can specify the `on` parameter to specify the name of the common column in both DataFrames that we want to join on. We can also specify the `suffixes` parameter like `join` method, if needed. 

## 3. Rename the columns with overlapping names

If we want to retain the same column names in both the DataFrames, we can simply rename one of the columns in one of the DataFrames, using the `rename` method.

``` python
df2.rename(columns={'column_name': 'new_column_name'}, inplace=True)
df1.join(df2)
```

In this method, we are renaming the column `column_name` in `df2` to `new_column_name` using the `rename` method. After this, we can use the `join` method to join both DataFrames.


# Summary

When joining two DataFrames, if the columns overlap and no suffix is specified, it leads to a value error. We can solve this problem by specifying the `suffixes` parameter in the `join` method or using the `merge` method. We can also rename one of the columns in one of the DataFrames using the `rename` method and then join the DataFrames.
