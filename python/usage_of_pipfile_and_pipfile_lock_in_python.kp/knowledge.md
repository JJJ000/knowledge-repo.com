# Overview

In Python, `pip` is a package manager that is used to install, upgrade, and manage Python packages. When working with Python projects, you may come across two files called `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`. These files serve different purposes but are both used as part of the package management process in Python. This article will explain what these files are, how they are used, and what their differences are.

# Pipfile

`Pipfile` is a configuration file used by `pipenv`, a package manager that is built on top of `pip`. `Pipfile` contains a list of dependencies for a project along with the version number of each dependency. The file is written in the `TOML` format, and it is usually located at the root directory of a Python project.

A typical `Pipfile` will contain a `[packages]` section that lists the dependencies for the project along with their version numbers. Here's an example:

```
[packages]
django = "==3.0.3"
djangorestframework = "==3.11.0"
```

This `Pipfile` specifies that the project depends on `django` version `3.0.3` and `djangorestframework` version `3.11.0`.

# Pipfile.lock

`Pipfile.lock` is a lock file that is automatically generated by `pipenv` when you install or update packages for a project. The file contains detailed information about the packages installed in a project, including their exact version numbers and dependencies.

`Pipfile.lock` is used to ensure that all developers working on a project use the same package versions. When a new developer joins the project, they can simply run `pipenv install` to install the packages specified in `Pipfile.lock`.

Here's an example of what a `Pipfile.lock` might look like:

```
{
    "_meta": {
        "hash": {
            "sha256": "2f7b65f1a900454e07cdb0cee3f3b9b9c0cb593717fb3a52c3ee1b3d3c140dbe"
        },

        "requires": {
            "python_version": "3.8"
        },
        "sources": [

                "verify_ssl": true
            }
        ]
    },

            ],
            "version": "==3.0.3"
        },
        "djangorestframework": {
            "hashes": [
                "sha256:816cddd7188f3036ae533a0a15fc6e34ec6f49a0ad591fe4ef0d6f34900ede8a",

            ],
            "version": "==2020.1"
        }
    },
    "develop": {}
}
```

# Conclusion

In summary, `Pipfile` is a configuration file used to specify the dependencies for a Python project, while `Pipfile.lock` is a lock file that is automatically generated to keep track of the exact versions of the packages installed in a project. `Pipfile` is created and edited manually, while `Pipfile.lock` is generated automatically and should not be edited manually. When using `pipenv`, both `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` are used together, with `Pipfile.lock` ensuring that all developers on a project are working with the same set of package dependencies.
