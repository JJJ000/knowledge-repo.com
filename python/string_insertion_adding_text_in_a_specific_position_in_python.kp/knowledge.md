# Initial Thoughts

Python provides several ways to append or insert a string into another string at a particular position. We can use slicing, concatination, and format() methods to do this.

1. Using slicing
2. Using concatenation
3. Using format() method


## Using Slicing

Slicing is one of the easiest ways of adding a string to a particular position in Python.

```python
str1 = "Hello World"
str2 = "Python"
position = 6
new_string = str1[:position] + str2 + str1[position:]
```

Here, we have defined two strings, str1, and str2. We want to add the str2 string at the position specified by the variable position (in this case, 6). To do this, we use slicing by splicing the str1 with [:position] and [position:] i.e, we take the characters in str1 up to the position specified ([:position]), add the new string, and then add the remaining characters from str1 after the position specified ([position:]).


## Using Concatenation


Concatenation is another way of adding a string at a particular position.

```python
str1 = "Hello World"
str2 = "Python"
position = 6
new_string = str1[:position] + str2 + str1[position:]
```

Here, we have used the + operator to concatenate the two strings. We have also used slicing to define the position where we want to add the new string.


## Using format() method

The format() method is also useful for adding a string at a particular position.

```python
str1 = "Hello World"
str2 = "Python"
position = 6
new_string = "{}{}{}".format(str1[:position], str2, str1[position:])
```

Here, we have used the format() method to concatenate the three strings. We have also used slicing to define the position where we want to add the new string.

# Conclusion

Python provides several ways to append or insert a string into another string at a particular position. We can use slicing, concatination, and format() methods. Slicing is the easiest way to achieve the task.
