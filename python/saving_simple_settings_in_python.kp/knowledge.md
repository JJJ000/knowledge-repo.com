tldr: You can save a simple settings/config file in Python by using the configparser module to create and write key-value pairs to a text file.

# Section 1: Define the Data Storage Format

The first step in saving a simple settings/config file is to define the data storage format. This format can be anything from a plain text file to a complex XML or JSON file structure. 

For this example, we will use a simple key-value pair structure where each setting is represented as a key-value pair. This structure can easily be stored in a plain text file or a JSON file.

# Section 2: Define the Settings

The next step is to define the settings that will be stored in the config file. These settings can be anything from a user's name to program preferences. 

For this example, we will use the following settings:

- username
- password
- email address
- favorite color

# Section 3: Create a Config File

After we have defined the data storage format and settings, we can create the config file. We can create the file using the built-in Python `open()` function and write the data to it.

```
config_file = open('config.txt', 'w')
config_file.write('username: john\n')
config_file.write('password: secret\n')
config_file.write('email: john@example.com\n')
config_file.write('favorite_color: blue\n')
config_file.close()
```

In this example, we create a file called `config.txt` and write the settings as key-value pairs separated by a colon. Once we are done writing to the file, we close it using the `close()` method.

# Section 4: Load and Use the Config File

Finally, we can load and use the config file in our Python program. We can read the file using the `open()` function and parse the key-value pairs using the `split()` method.

```
config_file = open('config.txt', 'r')
settings = {}
for line in config_file:
    key, value = line.split(': ')
    settings[key.strip()] = value.strip()
config_file.close()
```

In this example, we open the `config.txt` file in read mode and create a dictionary called `settings` to store the key-value pairs. We then loop through each line in the file and split the line into a key-value pair using the `split()` method. We then strip any extra whitespace and add the key-value pair to the `settings` dictionary.

Once we have loaded the config file into our `settings` dictionary, we can use the values in our program.

```
print('Hello ' + settings['username'])
print('Your favorite color is ' + settings['favorite_color'])
```

In this example, we retrieve the `username` and `favorite_color` settings from the `settings` dictionary and use them in our program.
