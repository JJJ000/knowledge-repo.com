# Fixing Python in Git Bash

## Step 1: Installing Python

The first step in fixing Python in Git Bash is to make sure Python is installed properly. To do this, you can download the latest version of Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). After downloading the installer, run it and follow the instructions to complete the installation.

## Step 2: Setting the Path

Once Python is installed, you need to set the path so that Git Bash can find the Python executable. To do this, open the Control Panel and go to System and Security > System > Advanced system settings. Then, select the Advanced tab and click the Environment Variables button. In the System variables section, find the Path variable and click Edit. Add the path to the Python executable to the end of the list and click OK.

## Step 3: Testing the Installation

Once the path is set, you can test the installation by opening Git Bash and typing in the command “python –version”. If Python is installed correctly, you should see the version number of Python displayed. If not, then you may need to troubleshoot further.

## Step 4: Troubleshooting

If you are still having trouble getting Python to work in Git Bash, you can try reinstalling Python, checking the path is set correctly, and making sure you are running the correct version of Python. If you are still having trouble, you can search online for more troubleshooting advice.
