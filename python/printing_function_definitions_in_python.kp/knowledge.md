tldr: Yes, Python can print a function definition using the built-in `print()` function and the `\_\_name\_\_` and `\_\_doc\_\_` attributes of the function.

[TOC]

Yes, Python can print a function definition. 

## Section 1: Defining a Function

In order to print a function definition, we first need to define a function. Here is an example function:

```python
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

This function takes in a parameter `name` and prints out a greeting with the provided name.

## Section 2: Using the `help()` Function

Python has a built-in `help()` function that can be used to print the documentation for a function. This documentation includes the function definition.

To use the `help()` function for our example `greet()` function, we can simply call `help(greet)`:

```python
help(greet)

Output:
Help on function greet in module __main__:

greet(name)
    Prints a greeting with the provided name.
```

As we can see, the `help()` function has printed out a documentation string for the `greet()` function, which includes the function definition.

## Section 3: Using the `inspect` Module

Another way to print a function definition is to use the `inspect` module in Python. This module provides several useful functions for inspecting Python objects, including functions.

Here is an example of using the `inspect` module to print the definition of our `greet()` function:

```python
import inspect

print(inspect.getsource(greet))

Output:
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

As we can see, the `getsource()` function from the `inspect` module has printed out the entire function definition for `greet()`.

## Section 4: Conclusion

In conclusion, Python can print a function definition using the `help()` function or the `inspect` module. By utilizing these tools, we can easily access the definition of any function in our Python code.
