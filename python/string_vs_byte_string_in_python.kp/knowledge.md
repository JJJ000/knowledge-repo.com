#### String
A string is a sequence of characters, written in either single or double quotes. Strings are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed once they have been created. They are also encoded in Unicode, which allows them to store a wide range of characters from different languages and scripts.

#### Byte String
A byte string is a sequence of bytes, which are numbers between 0 and 255. Byte strings are mutable, meaning that they can be changed after they have been created. They are also encoded in ASCII or UTF-8, which allows them to store only characters from the English language.
