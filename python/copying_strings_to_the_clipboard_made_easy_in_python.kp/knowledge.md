## Import the pyperclip library

The pyperclip library allows for easy accessing and manipulation of the clipboard. Therefore, the first step is to import the library in your Python code.

```python
import pyperclip
```

## Copy the string to the clipboard

To copy a string to the clipboard using pyperclip, use the `copy` method and pass the string as an argument. 

```python
pyperclip.copy('This string will be copied to the clipboard')
```

## Test the copied string

Finally, to test if the string was successfully copied to the clipboard, use the `paste` method, which returns the string value that is currently in the clipboard.

```python
print(pyperclip.paste())
```

The above code should output the string 'This string will be copied to the clipboard' if the copy was successful.
