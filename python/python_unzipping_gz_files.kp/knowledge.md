Section 1: Introduction
In Python, we can unzip a gzipped file using the gzip module. The gzip module provides a file-like interface to compressed data. It uses zlib library functions to compress and decompress data.
 
Section 2: Steps to unzip a gz file using Python
The steps to unzip a gz file are as follows:

1. Import the gzip module
```
import gzip
```
2. Open the gz file in read binary mode. For example,
```
with gzip.open('file.gz', 'rb') as f:
```
3. Read the compressed data from the file using the read() method. For example,
```
compressed_data = f.read()
```
4. Decompress the data using the decompress() method of the gzip module. For example,
```
uncompressed_data = gzip.decompress(compressed_data)
```
5. Write the uncompressed data to a new file. For example,
```
with open('uncompressed_file', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(uncompressed_data)
```

Section 3: Example Code
Here's an example Python code to unzip a gz file:
```
import gzip

with gzip.open('file.gz', 'rb') as f:
    compressed_data = f.read()

uncompressed_data = gzip.decompress(compressed_data)

with open('uncompressed_file', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(uncompressed_data)
```

Section 4: Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned how to unzip a gz file using Python. We use the gzip module to decompress the compressed data and write it to a new file.
