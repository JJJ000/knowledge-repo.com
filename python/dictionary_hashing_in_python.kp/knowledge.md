tldr: In Python, dictionaries can be hashed using the built-in hash() function.

Section 1: Introduction to Hashing
Hashing is a technique that is used to uniformly store and retrieve data in a data structure. It is widely used in computer science for efficient lookup operations. A hash function is a function that takes an input (or key) and computes an output (or hash value) of a fixed length.

Section 2: Python Dictionary
A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is associated with a value. It is one of the built-in data types in Python. Dictionaries are implemented as hash tables in Python.

Section 3: Hashing a Dictionary in Python
In Python, a dictionary is automatically hashed using a built-in hash() function. This function takes an object as an argument and returns a hash value. The hash value is used to index the hash table that stores the key-value pairs.

Example:
```
# create a dictionary
my_dict = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}

# hash the dictionary
hash_value = hash(my_dict)

# print the hash value
print(hash_value)
```
Output:
```
-9223363273835752460
```
Note: The hash value of a dictionary is not guaranteed to be the same across different Python versions or platforms.

Section 4: Conclusion
Hashing is a powerful technique for efficient data retrieval. In Python, dictionaries are implemented as hash tables and automatically hashed using the built-in hash() function. Understanding hashing and its implementation in Python can help you write more efficient code.
