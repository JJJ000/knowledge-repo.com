## Using the unittest.mock Library 
The unittest.mock library allows you to mock requests and responses in Python. It is a library that provides a core Mock class removing the need to create a host of stubs throughout your test suite.

The Mock class can be used to mock requests and responses in Python. It provides a way to replace parts of your system under test with mock objects and make assertions about how they have been used.

## Using the requests-mock Library
The requests-mock library is an extension to the requests library that allows you to mock requests and responses in Python. It provides an easy way to mock out the requests library and make assertions about the requests that have been made.

This library provides an easy way to mock out the requests library and make assertions about the requests that have been made. It also provides an easy way to set up your own custom responses and have them returned for specific requests.
