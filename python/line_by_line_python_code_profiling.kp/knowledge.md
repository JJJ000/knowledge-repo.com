tldr: Use a profiling tool like cProfile to measure the execution time of each line of code.

Section 1: Introduction to Profiling Python code
Profiling is a technique that helps to optimize and improve the performance of your Python code. Profiling enables you to identify the parts of your code that take up the most time and resources and then help you optimize those areas. Profiling can be done line-by-line, which means that you can see how much time each line of code takes to execute.

Section 2: Installing Profiling Tools
To profile Python code line-by-line, you need to install profiling tools. There are several profiling tools available, such as cProfile and PyCharm.  cProfile comes with Python and can be used in the terminal. PyCharm has a built-in profiler that can be accessed from the Run/Debug Configuration dialog box. To install cProfile, open the terminal and type in the following command:

```
pip install cprofilev
```

To install PyCharm, download and install the community edition of the PyCharm IDE from their website.

Section 3: Using cProfile to Profile Python Code
To use cProfile to profile Python code line-by-line, execute this command in the terminal:

```
python -m cProfile -o output_file.py path/to/python_script.py
```

This command runs the python script as usual, but the -m flag followed by cprofile instructs python to run the built-in profiler . The output_file.py argument specifies the name of the output file that will contain the profiling result. 

Section 4: Analyzing the Profiling Results
After running the profiling script, you can analyze the profiling result using the PStats module that comes with cProfile. To analyze the result, execute the following code in the terminal:

```
python -m pstats output_file.py
```

This code loads the profiling result and opens an interactive console where you can interact with the stats. Once the stats are loaded, you can use different commands to analyze the profiling result such as sorting the stats by the total time or cumulative time of each function or method. The most important stat to look for is the “tottime” (total time) which is the total time the function/method has spent executing without including the time spent by the functions/methods it calls.
