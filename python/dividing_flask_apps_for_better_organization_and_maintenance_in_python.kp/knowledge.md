# Introduction
Flask is a web framework used for building web applications using the Python programming language. As applications grow in complexity, so does the code base. This can make it difficult to manage all the code in just one file. Therefore, it is important to divide your Flask application into multiple files. This article will show you how to divide your Flask app into multiple Python files.

# Create a Package
The first step in dividing your Flask application into multiple files is to create a package. A package is a collection of modules that can be used together to provide functionality for your application. To create a package, create a new directory in your project and give it a meaningful name. Inside the directory, create a file named __init__.py. This file is required to make the directory a package in Python. 

```python
    myapp/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── main.py
    ├── models.py
    ├── views.py
    └── utils.py
```

# Define Modules
After creating a package, define the modules that will contain your application code. In a Flask application, you typically have three types of modules:

1. Models
2. Views
3. Utils

Models contain the data models of your application while views contain the actual code that handles requests and responses. Utils contain utility functions that assist your views to perform tasks.

# Import Modules
Now that you have defined your modules, you need to import them into your Flask application. First, import the Flask instance from the flask package in the __init__.py file. Then, import each module into the __init__.py file using the syntax “from package_name.modulename import function_name”. Finally, use the app object to add the views to your Flask application.

```python
    from flask import Flask
    from myapp.views import foo

    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.register_blueprint(foo)
```

# Conclusion
Dividing your Flask application into multiple files can make your code more organized and easier to manage. Remember to create a package, define modules, and import them into your Flask application. This will ensure that your application functions smoothly and is easy to maintain.
