### Introduction

`ugettext_lazy` is a utility function that is part of the translation infrastructure in Django. It is used to defer the translation of strings until they are actually needed. In this article, we will discuss the situations in which `ugettext_lazy` should be used in Python.

### Dynamic texts

In situations where text is being generated dynamically, it is impossible to use the `ugettext` function because the text has not yet been generated at the time the translation function is invoked. In this case, `ugettext_lazy` should be used instead. `ugettext_lazy` returns a lazy object that is only resolved when the value is requested, which ensures that the translation occurs at the appropriate time. 

### Performance

Using `ugettext_lazy` can improve the performance of your Django application. When a view generates a large number of responses, using `ugettext` can have a significant impact on the application's performance because it will translate every string when the view is loaded. However, using `ugettext_lazy` defers the translation until it is actually needed, which can reduce the number of unnecessary translations and improve performance.

### Templates

When using Django templates, `ugettext_lazy` is often required. This is because templates are evaluated lazily, which means that if `ugettext` is used to translate a string, the string will be translated when the template is compiled, which is not what is intended. Instead, `ugettext_lazy` should be used to defer the translation until the string is actually rendered, which ensures that the translation is performed correctly.

### Wrapped in translation markers

When using `ugettext_lazy`, it is important to wrap the translatable string in a translation marker. The translation marker consists of a function call that specifies the string to be translated, as well as its context. This allows Django to identify the string as translatable and extract it for translation. 

### Conclusion

In conclusion, `ugettext_lazy` should be used when text is being generated dynamically, when performance is a concern, when using Django templates, and when the text is wrapped in translation markers. By using `ugettext_lazy` in these situations, you can ensure that your Django application is both performant and accurate in its translations.
