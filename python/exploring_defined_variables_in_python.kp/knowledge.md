[TOC]

# Local Variables

Local variables are defined within a function and can only be accessed within that function. 

# Global Variables

Global variables are defined outside of all functions and can be accessed from any part of the program.

# Built-in Variables

Built-in variables are predefined variables that are provided by the Python interpreter. These variables are usually named with leading and trailing underscores. Examples of built-in variables include `__name__`, `__file__`, and `__doc__`.

# Enclosing Scope Variables

Enclosing scope variables are variables that are defined in the enclosing scope of a function. These variables can be accessed from within a nested function.
