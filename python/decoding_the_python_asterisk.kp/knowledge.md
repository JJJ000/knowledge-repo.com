# Introduction 

When working with Python, there are many operators available to use. One of them is the `*` operator, which is commonly used for multiplication. 

However, there is a specific name for the `*` operator when it is used in different contexts. In this article, we will explore the different names of the `*` operator in Python. 

# The * Operator for Multiplication 

When the `*` operator is used for multiplication, it is simple referred to as the multiplication operator. It is used to multiply two or more numbers together. 

For example, if we want to multiply 2 and 3, we can use the following expression: 

```
2 * 3
```

The result would be 6. 

# The * Operator for Repetition 

In Python, the `*` operator can also be used for repetition. When used in this context, it is referred to as the repetition operator. 

This operator is used to repeat a sequence of characters or values a certain number of times. 

For example, if we want to repeat the string "hello" five times, we can use the following expression: 

```
"hello" * 5
```

The result would be the string "hellohellohellohellohello". 

# The * Operator for Unpacking 

Another use for the `*` operator in Python is for unpacking. When used in this way, it is referred to as the unpacking operator. 

This operator is used to unpack elements from an iterable object, such as a list or tuple. 

For example, if we have a list of numbers and we want to pass them as arguments to a function, we can use the following expression: 

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_function(*numbers)
```

In this case, the `*` operator will unpack the numbers from the list and pass them as separate arguments to the function. 

# Conclusion 

The `*` operator in Python is a versatile operator that can be used for multiplication, repetition, and unpacking. By understanding the different names and contexts for this operator, you can use it effectively in your Python code.
