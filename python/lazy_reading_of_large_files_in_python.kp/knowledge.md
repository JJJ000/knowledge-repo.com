## Section 1: Overview

Lazy method for reading big files in Python is a technique that allows you to read large files without loading the entire contents of the file into memory. This technique is useful when dealing with large files that cannot be loaded into memory all at once. The lazy method works by only loading the data that is needed at the time, and then discarding it when it is no longer needed. This allows the file to be read without having to load the entire contents of the file into memory.

## Section 2: Advantages

One of the main advantages of using the lazy method for reading big files in Python is that it improves the performance of the program. This is because the program does not have to load the entire contents of the file into memory, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. Additionally, this technique can also save memory, as only the data that is needed is loaded into memory.

## Section 3: Disadvantages

One of the main disadvantages of using the lazy method for reading big files in Python is that it can be more difficult to debug. This is because the program is only loading the data that is needed at the time, and not the entire contents of the file. Additionally, this technique can also be slower than loading the entire contents of the file into memory, as the program has to constantly load and discard data.

## Section 4: Conclusion

The lazy method for reading big files in Python can be a useful technique when dealing with large files that cannot be loaded into memory all at once. This technique can improve the performance of the program, as well as save memory, as only the data that is needed is loaded into memory. However, it can be more difficult to debug and can be slower than loading the entire contents of the file into memory.
