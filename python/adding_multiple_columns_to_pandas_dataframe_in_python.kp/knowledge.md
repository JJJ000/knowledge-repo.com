tldr: You can add multiple columns to a pandas dataframe by passing a dictionary of column names and their corresponding values to the dataframe constructor.

Section 1: Introduction
Pandas is a popular data analysis library in python that provides easy to use data structures and functions for data manipulation. One of the key data structures in pandas is the DataFrame, which is used to represent tabular data in python. While working with dataframes, many times, we need to add multiple columns to the dataframe in one go. In this tutorial, we will see different ways to add multiple columns to pandas dataframe in one assignment.

Section 2: Using assign method
The assign method is a convenient way to add multiple columns to a pandas dataframe in one assignment. The syntax for the assign method is as follows:

```
df.assign(col1 = val1, col2 = val2, col3 = val3....)
```

Here df is the pandas dataframe to which we want to add columns, and col1, col2, col3 are the names of the columns we want to add. val1, val2, val3 are the values for these columns. 

Example:

```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})
df = df.assign(C=[10, 20, 30], D=[40, 50, 60])
print(df)
```

Output:

```
   A  B   C   D
0  1  4  10  40
1  2  5  20  50
2  3  6  30  60
```
Here we have added two new columns C and D to the dataframe df using the assign method.

Section 3: Using dictionary and for loop
Another way to add multiple columns to a pandas dataframe is by using a dictionary and a for loop. The steps involved in this method are as follows:

1. Create a dictionary with keys as the column names and values as the column values.
2. Iterate over the dictionary using a for loop and add each key-value pair to the dataframe.

Example:

```
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]})
new_cols = {'C': [10, 20, 30], 'D': [40, 50, 60]}

for col_name, col_data in new_cols.items():
    df[col_name] = col_data

print(df)
```

Output:

```
   A  B   C   D
0  1  4  10  40
1  2  5  20  50
2  3  6  30  60
```
Here we have created a dictionary new_cols with keys C and D and their respective values. We then used a for loop to iterate over the dictionary and add each key-value pair to the dataframe df.

Section 4: Conclusion
In this tutorial, we saw different ways to add multiple columns to a pandas dataframe in one assignment. The assign method is a convenient way to add columns, while using a dictionary and for loop is a more customizable approach. It's a good practice to use the method that suits your use case and helps you get your work done efficiently.
