### Using DateTimeField

Using a DateTimeField, you can easily filter query objects by date range in Django using the standard query syntax.

```
MyModel.objects.filter(date_field__range=('start_date', 'end_date'))
```

Where `start_date` and `end_date` are date objects.

### Using Q Objects

You can also use Q objects to filter query objects by date range in Django.

```
from django.db.models import Q

MyModel.objects.filter(Q(date_field__gte=start_date) & Q(date_field__lte=end_date))
```

Where `start_date` and `end_date` are date objects.

### Using Subqueries

You can also use subqueries to filter query objects by date range in Django.

```
from django.db.models import OuterRef, Subquery

MyModel.objects.filter(date_field__in=Subquery(MyModel.objects.filter(date_field__range=(start_date, end_date)).values('date_field')))
```

Where `start_date` and `end_date` are date objects.

### Using Raw SQL

Finally, you can also use raw SQL to filter query objects by date range in Django.

```
MyModel.objects.raw('SELECT * FROM myapp_mymodel WHERE date_field BETWEEN %s AND %s', [start_date, end_date])
```

Where `start_date` and `end_date` are date objects.
