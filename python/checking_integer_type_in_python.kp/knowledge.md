**Checking for Integer Type**

Python has a built-in function, `isinstance()`, to check if a variable is of a certain type. To check if a variable is an integer, we can use `isinstance()` as follows:

```
isinstance(x, int)
```

This will return `True` if `x` is an integer, and `False` if it is not.

**Checking for Integer Value**

In addition to checking for the type of a variable, we can also check if the value of the variable is an integer. To do this, we can use the `is_integer()` function from the `math` module:

```
import math
math.is_integer(x)
```

This will return `True` if `x` is an integer, and `False` if it is not.

**Checking for Numeric Value**

Finally, we can also check if a variable is a numeric value, which includes integers and floats. To do this, we can use the `isnumeric()` function from the `string` module:

```
import string
string.isnumeric(x)
```

This will return `True` if `x` is a numeric value, and `False` if it is not.
