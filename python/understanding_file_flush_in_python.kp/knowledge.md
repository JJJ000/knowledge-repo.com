tldr: The file.flush() function forces any unwritten data to be written to the file.

[TOC]

### 1. Overview

In Python, `file.flush()` is a method used to forcefully write any data that has been buffered and still hasn't been written to the file.

### 2. Buffered Input/Output

When working with files, the default behavior is to write the data to a buffer first, which is a temporary storage location in memory. This is referred to as buffered input/output (I/O). The purpose of buffering is to improve performance and efficiency while working with files, as writing data to a file directly can be a slow process. 

### 3. Usage in Python

In Python, buffered I/O is used by default when writing to a file. This means that when we write data using the `write()` method, the data is first stored in memory, and not written to the file until the buffer is full, or until we manually flush the buffer using the `flush()` method. 

### 4. The `file.flush()` Method 

The `file.flush()` method is used to force Python to write any data that has been buffered to the file. This can be useful when we want to ensure that all data is written to the file immediately, rather than waiting for the buffer to fill up or waiting for the file to be closed. This is particularly useful when working with large amounts of data, or when we need to ensure that data has been written to a file before continuing with other operations.
