## C
C is a compiled language, which means that it is first translated into machine code before it can be run. As a result, C programs tend to be very fast and efficient. C is also a low-level language, which makes it very close to the hardware and allows it to directly access memory, which can be very useful for solving problems on Project Euler.

## Python
Python is an interpreted language, which means that it does not need to be compiled before it is run. This makes it much easier to write and debug code, as well as reducing the time needed to get a program running. However, Python is a higher-level language than C, which means that it is not as close to the hardware and is not able to directly access memory. As a result, Python programs tend to be slower and less efficient than C programs.

## Erlang
Erlang is a functional language, which means that it is designed to make it easier to write programs that are concurrent and distributed. This makes it well-suited for solving problems on Project Euler that require a lot of parallel computation or communication between distributed nodes. However, Erlang is an interpreted language, which means that it is not as fast or efficient as a compiled language like C.

## Haskell
Haskell is a purely functional language, which means that it is designed to make it easier to write programs that are free of side-effects and can be reasoned about mathematically. This makes it well-suited for solving problems on Project Euler that require a lot of mathematical reasoning. However, Haskell is an interpreted language, which means that it is not as fast or efficient as a compiled language like C.
