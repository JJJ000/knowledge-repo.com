Section 1: Problem Statement
When reading a csv file in pandas, sometimes there is an extra column added as an index. In many cases, this index is redundant and needs to be removed. This task can be cumbersome if the csv file has a large number of columns. This section discusses the problem statement and the importance of eliminating the index column.

Section 2: Solution without eliminating the column
By default, when you read a csv file with pandas, the first column of the file becomes the index column of the dataframe. We can access the index column using the `.index` method, which returns a pandas Index object. In this section, we discuss a solution that doesn't eliminate the index column but instead moves it into our dataframe as a column. To do this, we can use the `reset_index()` method. The code snippet below illustrates how to use the `reset_index()` method.

```
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Move the index column to a column in the dataframe
df = df.reset_index()
```

Section 3: Solution by eliminating the column
While the previous solution is useful in some cases, there are still situations where we need to eliminate the index column. In this section, we discuss a solution that removes the index column completely. Pandas provides an additional parameter, `index_col`, in the `read_csv()` method that we can set to `None` to avoid attaching the first column as an index. The code snippet below illustrates how to use the `index_col` parameter.

```
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', index_col=None)
```

Section 4: Conclusion
In conclusion, removing the index column in pandas is essential in cleaning up data sets. We can use the solutions discussed in this article to eliminate index columns when they are not required. While the solution that moves the index column to a column in the dataframe can be useful, using the `index_col` parameter when reading the csv is the most straightforward solution.
