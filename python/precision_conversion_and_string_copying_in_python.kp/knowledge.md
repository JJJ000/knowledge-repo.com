tldr: Use the format method with the appropriate formatting specifier and pass the result to the str function to convert the float to a string with the specified precision.

Section 1: Introduction 
In some cases, it is necessary to convert a floating point number to a certain precision and then copy it to a string in Python. This can be done using the format() function in Python.

Section 2: Using the format() function to convert a floating point number to a certain precision
The format() function can be used to convert a float to a string with a specific precision. The syntax for this is as follows:

formatted_number = format(number, '.precisionf')

Here, 'number' is the floating-point number to be converted, and 'precision' specifies the number of decimal places to include. The 'f' at the end is required to indicate that we are formatting a floating-point number.

For example, if we have the floating-point number 3.14159265359 and we want to convert it to a string with 2 decimal places, we can use the following code:

number = 3.14159265359
precision = 2
formatted_number = format(number, '.{}f'.format(precision))

The resulting string would be '3.14'.

Section 3: Copying the formatted number to a string
Once we have the formatted number, we can copy it to a string using Python's built-in str() function. The code would look like this:

number = 3.14159265359
precision = 2
formatted_number = format(number, '.{}f'.format(precision))
formatted_string = str(formatted_number)

The resulting string would be '3.14'.

Section 4: Conclusion
In Python, we can use the format() function to convert a floating-point number to a certain precision and then copy it to a string using the str() function. This can be useful in many applications where we need to display numerical data to a certain level of precision.
