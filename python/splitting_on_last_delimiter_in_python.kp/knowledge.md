# Section 1: Splitting on Last Delimiter
The simplest way to split a string on the last delimiter is to use the `rsplit()` method. This method takes two arguments: the delimiter and the number of splits to make. The default value for the number of splits is -1, which means that the string will be split on the last occurrence of the delimiter.

# Section 2: Using rsplit()
Using `rsplit()` is simple. To use it, simply pass the string and the delimiter as arguments. For example, to split a string on the last occurrence of a comma, you would do the following:

```
my_string = "This, is, a, string"
split_string = my_string.rsplit(',', 1)
```

# Section 3: Result
The result of the above code is a list containing two strings: `['This, is, a', 'string']`. The first string contains all the characters before the last comma, and the second string contains all the characters after the last comma.

# Section 4: Other Methods
In addition to `rsplit()`, there are several other ways to split a string on the last delimiter. For example, you can use the `str.split()` method with a negative index, or you can use the `str.partition()` method.
