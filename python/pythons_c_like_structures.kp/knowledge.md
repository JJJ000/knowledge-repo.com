tldr: Python has dictionaries and tuples, which are similar to C-like structures.

[TOC]

**Section 1: Structs**

Structs are data structures that allow the storage of multiple different data types in a single entity. In Python, structs are represented by the namedtuple class which is part of the collections module. Namedtuples are immutable objects that are accessed by index or by name.

**Section 2: Lists**

Lists are Python data structures that allow for the storage of multiple data elements of the same type. Lists are mutable and accessed by index. They are commonly used for storing data in a linear fashion.

**Section 3: Dictionaries**

Dictionaries are Python data structures that allow for the storage of multiple data elements of the same type. Dictionaries are mutable and accessed by keys. They are commonly used for storing data in a key-value format.

**Section 4: Sets**

Sets are Python data structures that allow for the storage of multiple data elements of the same type. Sets are mutable and accessed by their elements. They are commonly used for storing data in an unordered fashion.
