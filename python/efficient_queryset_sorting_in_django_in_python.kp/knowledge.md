tldr: Use the order\_by() method to sort by one or more fields, or use the annotate() method to add annotations and sort by those values.

## Sorting QuerySets in Django

Django offers several methods for sorting QuerySets. A QuerySet is a collection of database objects retrieved from the database. Sorting QuerySets allows you to organize retrieved data in specific and logical ways. 

Here are four common ways to sort QuerySets in Django:


### 1. sort by a single field

Django's ```order_by()``` method allows you to sort a queryset by a single field of that model. The method takes one or multiple fields as arguments. The minus sign (-) sorts the results in descending order.

```python
from app.models import MyModel

sorted_qs = MyModel.objects.all().order_by('field_to_sort_by')
```

### 2. sort by multiple fields 

You can chain field names to sort a queryset by multiple fields. The order in which you chain the fields determines the primary and subsequent sorting criteria.

```python
 from app.models import MyModel

sorted_qs = MyModel.objects.all().order_by('field1', '-field2')
```

### 3. sort by related object's fields

If you have related Django models with related fields in the database, you can sort results based on one or multiple related fields.

```python
from app.models import MyModel, RelatedModel

sorted_qs = MyModel.objects.all().order_by('related_model__field_to_sort_by')
```

### 4. sort by custom functions

In Django, you can use Python functions to sort querysets. This method allows you to control the precise processing of the data returned.

```python
from app.models import MyModel

def custom_sorting_function(obj):
    # perform custom processing
    return sorted_by_criteria

sorted_qs = sorted(MyModel.objects.all(), key=custom_sorting_function)
```

Conclusion:

Django's sorting methods make retrieving and organizing data from Django models simple and flexible. The four most common ways to sort querysets in Django are ```order_by()``` for sorting by a single field, chain to sort by multiple fields, ```__related_field``` to sort by related fields, and custom sorting functions. By mastering these methods, you can create efficient database queries and ensure that retrieved data is sorted logically.
