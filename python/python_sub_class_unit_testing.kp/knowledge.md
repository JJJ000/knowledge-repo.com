tldr: You can write Python unit tests for both base and sub classes using any unit testing framework, such as unittest or pytest, by creating separate test cases for each class and testing their respective methods and behaviors.

Section 1: Introduction 
In this article, we will discuss how to write unit tests for a base class and its subclasses in Python. Testing is an important aspect of software development as it increases the reliability and reduces the chances of bugs in the code. 

Section 2: Writing Unit Tests for Base Class 
One approach is to write separate unit tests for each method of the base class. We can create a test case class that inherits from the unittest.TestCase class and define methods that test the functionality of each method in the base class. For example, suppose we have a base class called Shape. We can create a test case class called TestShape and define methods to test the methods in the Shape class, such as test_area(), test_perimeter(), and so on. 

Section 3: Writing Unit Tests for Subclasses 
Similar to the base class, we can create a test case class for each subclass that inherits from the TestShape class. In these test case classes, we can define methods that test the specific functionality of the subclass. For example, suppose we have a subclass called Rectangle that inherits from Shape. We can create a test case class called TestRectangle and define methods to test the functionality of the Rectangle class, such as test_diagonal(), test_width(), and so on. 

Section 4: Integration Testing 
Integration testing is a type of testing in which we test the integration between different components of the system. In our case, we can write integration tests to test the integration between the base class and its subclasses. We can create a test case class called TestIntegration and define methods that test the integration between the Shape class and its subclasses, such as test_area_calculation(), test_perimeter_calculation(), and so on. 

In conclusion, writing unit tests helps us to ensure the reliability and robustness of our code. We can write separate unit tests for the base class and its subclasses, and perform integration testing to test the interaction between different components.
