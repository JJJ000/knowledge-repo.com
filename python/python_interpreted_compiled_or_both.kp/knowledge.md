Python: A Hybrid Language

Python is a high-level programming language that is both interpreted and compiled. It offers developers the flexibility to choose between the two modes of execution, depending on the use case and requirements of their project. 

### Interpreted

Python is primarily an interpreted language. This means that when we run a Python script, the interpreter reads the code, translates it into bytecode, and executes it line by line without compiling the entire codebase into machine-readable instructions at once. This approach offers several benefits, such as being able to immediately see the output of changes and ease of debugging. 

### Compiled

Python also supports compilation. While Python code is not natively compiled into machine code, it can be compiled into bytecode (.pyc) files for faster execution. The compilation process happens automatically, behind the scenes, in a transparent manner to the user. The compiled bytecode files can be executed on any platform that has the same version of Python. 

### Hybrid

Python's dual nature as an interpreted and compiled language makes it a hybrid language. Developers can use the interpreted mode to quickly test and prototype their code, while the compiled mode can improve performance for production environments. The ability to switch between interpreted and compiled modes gives Python a development workflow that's both agile and robust. 

### Summary

In summary, Python is an interpreted language that also supports JIT compilation. While not a strictly compiled language, Python can be compiled to bytecode for performance optimizations. The hybrid nature of Python makes the language flexible and versatile, letting developers choose the method of execution that best suits their needs.
