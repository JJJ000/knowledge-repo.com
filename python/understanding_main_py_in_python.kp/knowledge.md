# Overview
__main__.py is an entry point for Python programs. It is a special Python module that is automatically executed when a program is run directly from the command line.

# Purpose
This module serves as a starting point for the program, allowing the code to be organized in a logical manner and making it easier to debug. It also allows the program to be executed in a specific order, ensuring that all of the necessary initialization steps are taken before running the program.

# Usage
To use __main__.py, the program must be written in a way that takes advantage of the module's features. This typically involves importing the module and then using it to execute the program's code. Additionally, the module can be used to set up global variables and other data structures, as well as to define functions and classes that can be used throughout the program.

# Benefits
Using __main__.py helps to make programs more organized and easier to maintain. It also helps to ensure that the necessary initialization steps are taken before the program is executed. Additionally, it makes it easier to debug the program since the code is organized in a logical manner.
