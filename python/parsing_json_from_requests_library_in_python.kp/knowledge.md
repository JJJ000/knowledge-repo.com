#1 Using the json Library
The json library is a built-in library in Python and can be used to parse JSON responses from the requests library. It can be imported with the following code:

`import json`

Once imported, the json library can be used to parse a JSON response from the requests library by using the json.loads() method:

`data = json.loads(response.text)`

#2 Using the json.loads() Method
The json.loads() method is a built-in method in the json library. It takes a JSON string and returns a Python dictionary. It can be used to parse a JSON response from the requests library like this:

`data = json.loads(response.text)`

#3 Using the json.load() Method
The json.load() method is a built-in method in the json library. It takes a file-like object and returns a Python dictionary. It can be used to parse a JSON response from the requests library like this:

`with open('response.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)`

#4 Using the requests Library
The requests library also has a built-in JSON decoder which can be used to parse a JSON response from the requests library. It can be used like this:

`data = response.json()`
