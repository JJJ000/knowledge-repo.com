tldr: Namedtuples should be used over dictionaries when there is a need for lightweight objects with a small, fixed set of fields or attributes.

Advantages of namedtuple over a dictionary

1. Easy access to elements

Namedtuples are similar to tuples but give names to each of the fields so that they can be accessed by name rather than by index, making the code more readable and reducing the chances of errors. Dictionaries, on the other hand, require elements to be accessed by keys, which can be more cumbersome.

2. Immutable

Namedtuples are immutable, which means their values cannot be changed after instantiation. This feature can be useful in situations where you want to prevent the values from being accidentally modified.

3. Memory efficient

Namedtuples take up less memory than dictionaries since they do not require the overhead of storing keys. In situations where a large number of objects need to be created, using namedtuples over dictionaries can lead to better performance and less memory usage.

When to use a dictionary over a namedtuple?

1. Dynamic data

If the data is dynamic or frequently changes, a dictionary can be a more appropriate choice than a namedtuple since values can be easily modified using key-value pairs.

2. Additional functionality

If additional functionality is needed beyond simple access to elements or when creating a data object, dictionaries can be extended with custom methods, making them more flexible than namedtuples.

In summary, namedtuples are a useful alternative to dictionaries when data needs to be accessed by name rather than key and when immutability is desired. Dictionaries, on the other hand, are better suited for dynamic data and additional functionality beyond simple access to elements.
