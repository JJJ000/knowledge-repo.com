#1 Writing a Test

The first step in testing a Python function to see if it throws an exception is to write a test. This can be done by using a test framework such as pytest or unittest. The test should include an assertion that the function should raise an exception when it is called.

#2 Executing the Test

Once the test has been written, it should be executed. This can be done by running the test script from the command line. If the test passes, the function is confirmed to throw an exception when it is called.

#3 Analyzing the Results

The results of the test should be analyzed to ensure that the exception was raised as expected. It is important to check that the exception was raised with the correct arguments, as well as that the exception was raised at the correct point in the code.

#4 Debugging

If the test fails, the code should be debugged to determine why the exception was not raised. This can be done by stepping through the code in a debugger, or by adding additional logging or print statements to the code to trace the execution.
