tldr: Use the `for line in open(filename)` syntax to iterate through the lines of the text file without loading it into memory.

1. Using the `open()` Method
--------------------------------
The `open()` method can be used to read large text files line by line without loading them into memory. This method is best used when the file is too large to fit in memory.

2. Using the `readline()` Method
--------------------------------
The `readline()` method can be used to read large text files line by line without loading them into memory. This method reads one line at a time, allowing the user to process each line as it is read.

3. Using the `for` Loop
------------------------
The `for` loop can be used to read large text files line by line without loading them into memory. This method reads one line at a time and then processes the line before moving on to the next line.

4. Using the `while` Loop
-------------------------
The `while` loop can be used to read large text files line by line without loading them into memory. This method reads one line at a time and then processes the line before moving on to the next line.
