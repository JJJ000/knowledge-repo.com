1. Using the `re.split()` Method

The `re.split()` method can be used to split a string and keep the separators. This method takes a regular expression pattern as an argument and splits the string accordingly. The separators are included in the returned list.

2. Using the `re.findall()` Method

The `re.findall()` method can also be used to split a string and keep the separators. This method takes a regular expression pattern as an argument and returns a list of all non-overlapping matches in the string. This means that the separators are also included in the returned list.

3. Using the `str.split()` Method

The `str.split()` method can be used to split a string and keep the separators. This method takes a separator as an argument and splits the string accordingly. The separator is included in the returned list.

4. Using the `str.partition()` Method

The `str.partition()` method can also be used to split a string and keep the separators. This method takes a separator as an argument and returns a tuple containing the part before the separator, the separator itself, and the part after the separator. The separator is included in the returned tuple.
