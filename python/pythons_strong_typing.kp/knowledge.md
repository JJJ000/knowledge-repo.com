#### Yes
Python is strongly typed, meaning that you cannot mix types in a single expression. For example, you cannot add a string and an integer together without explicitly converting one of them to the other type.

#### Type Checking
Python also performs type checking when a function is called. All arguments passed to a function must match the types of the parameters in the function definition. If the types do not match, an error will be thrown.

#### Type Conversion
Python also allows for type conversion. This means that you can convert a value from one type to another. For example, you can convert an integer to a string, or a string to an integer.

#### Dynamically Typed
Python is also dynamically typed, meaning that you do not need to specify the type of a variable when you declare it. This allows for more flexibility when writing code, as you can assign a different type to a variable at any time.
