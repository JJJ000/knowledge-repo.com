tldr: You can use the string method `split()` to remove all characters after a specific character in Python by splitting the string at the specific character and then selecting the first element of the resulting list using indexing.

Section 1: Introduction
In this tutorial, we will discuss how to remove all characters after a specific character in Python. This can be useful when you want to extract a substring from a larger string that occurs before a particular character.

Section 2: Using the split() method
One way to remove all characters after a specific character is to use the split() method. This method splits a string into a list of substrings based on a specified separator. We can then grab the first element of the list to get the substring before the specified character. Here is an example:

```
string = "Hello, world!"
separator = ","
substring = string.split(separator)[0]
print(substring)
```

This will output "Hello".

Section 3: Using the index() method
Another way to remove all characters after a specific character is to use the index() method. This method finds the first occurrence of a specified substring within a string and returns its index. We can then slice the string up to that index to get the substring before the specified character. Here is an example:

```
string = "Hello, world!"
separator = ","
index = string.index(separator)
substring = string[:index]
print(substring)
```

This will output "Hello".

Section 4: Conclusion
In this tutorial, we looked at two methods for removing all characters after a specific character in Python. The split() method is useful for when we know the exact character we want to split on, while the index() method is more versatile and can find the index of any substring.
