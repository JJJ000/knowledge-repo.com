[TOC]

# Causes
The "ImportError: No module named" error occurs when a module that is not installed on the system is imported into a Python program. Python looks for the module in the list of directories that make up the sys.path variable. If the module is not found, an ImportError is raised.

# Troubleshooting
1. Check if the module is installed on the system:
    - On Windows, open the command prompt and type `pip list`. This will list all installed packages.
    - On Linux/macOS, open the terminal and type `pip3 list`.
2. If the module is not installed, install it using pip:
    - On Windows, open the command prompt and type `pip install <module_name>`.
    - On Linux/macOS, open the terminal and type `pip3 install <module_name>`.
3. If the module is installed, check if it is in the sys.path variable:
    - Open the Python interpreter and type `import sys` followed by `sys.path`. This will list all directories that are part of the sys.path variable.
    - If the module is not in the list, add the path to the sys.path variable.

# Conclusion
The "ImportError: No module named" error occurs when a module that is not installed on the system is imported into a Python program. To troubleshoot this error, check if the module is installed, and if it is, check if it is in the sys.path variable. If it is not, add the path to the sys.path variable.
