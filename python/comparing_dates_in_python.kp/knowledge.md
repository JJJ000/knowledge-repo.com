tldr: You can compare two dates in Python by using the comparison operators (>, <, ==, etc.) on the datetime objects.

### Option 1: Using the datetime Module

The datetime module provides classes for manipulating dates and times in both simple and complex ways. The datetime module also provides a class specifically designed to compare two dates. To compare two dates, simply create two datetime objects and subtract one from the other. The result will be a datetime.timedelta object, which holds the difference between the two dates in days, seconds, and microseconds.

### Option 2: Using the Operator Module

The operator module provides a set of functions that can be used to compare two dates. The operator module contains functions for comparing dates, such as lt(), gt(), le(), and ge(). To compare two dates, simply pass the two dates to the appropriate operator function. The result will be a boolean value indicating whether the first date is less than, greater than, or equal to the second date.

### Option 3: Using the Timedelta Class

The timedelta class is a subclass of the datetime module and provides a way to represent and compare the time difference between two dates. To compare two dates, simply calculate the difference between the two dates and store it in a timedelta object. The timedelta object will contain the difference between the two dates in days, seconds, and microseconds.

### Option 4: Using the strptime() Function

The strptime() function is a part of the datetime module and can be used to parse a string representing a date and time into a datetime object. To compare two dates, simply parse both strings using the strptime() function and then subtract one from the other. The result will be a datetime.timedelta object, which holds the difference between the two dates in days, seconds, and microseconds.
