tldr: Download the package and its dependencies as wheel files, then use the pip install command with the file paths to install them locally.

## Introduction 
In some scenarios, we might not have access to the internet, and downloading packages using pip won't be an option. In this case, we can use the offline installation of Python packages. This method enables us to install Python packages frrom the local machine without an internet connection. Here, in this guide, we will learn how to install packages offline in Python.

## Step 1: Download the package
You need to access the specific package that you want to install offline. One way to download the package is by using the `pip download` command. The pip download command downloads the python package along with its dependencies in a tar file format. The below command downloads the NumPy tar file and its dependencies (you can change NumPy with your package of choice):


```python 
pip download --dest=/path/to/dir numpy
```

## Step 2: Transfer the package
After downloading the package in a tar file format, transfer the package and dependencies into the target machine.

## Step 3: Install the package
Once the package and dependencies transfer is completed, navigate to the directory with the tar file and execute the below command to install it:


```python 
pip install --no-index --find-links=path/to/dir package-name.tar.gz
```

In the above command, `--no-index` specifies that pip should not contact the package index while installing the package. The `--find-links` parameter is used to specify the path to the directory containing the package.

## Conclusion 
In this guide, we learned how to install Python packages offline. We used the pip download command to download the packages along with its dependencies and then installed them using the pip install command on the target machine.
