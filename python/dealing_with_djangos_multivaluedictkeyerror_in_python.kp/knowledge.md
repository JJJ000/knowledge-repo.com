tldr: Check if the key is in the dictionary before accessing it, or use the get() method with a default value.

# Understanding MultiValueDictKeyError

MultiValueDictKeyError is a type of error that occurs when an item in a dictionary-like object is accessed with a key that does not exist. It is a runtime error that can be raised in Python, specifically when using Django. The error message usually includes the name of the dictionary-like object and the key that was attempted to access.

# Handling MultiValueDictKeyError

To handle MultiValueDictKeyError in Python, there are several approaches that can be taken. Here are four possible ways:

## 1. Using the get() method

The get() method is a built-in function in Python that can be used to retrieve the value of a given key in a dictionary-like object. Unlike using square brackets to access a key, the get() method does not raise an error when the key is not found. Instead, it returns None, or a default value specified as a second argument. Here's an example:

```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

# Using the [] operator (raises an error)
print(my_dict['c']) # Raises KeyError: 'c'

# Using get() with a default value (returns None)
print(my_dict.get('c')) # Prints None

# Using get() with a custom default value (returns -1)
print(my_dict.get('c', -1)) # Prints -1
```

## 2. Checking for key existence beforehand

Another way to avoid MultiValueDictKeyError is to check whether the key exists in the dictionary-like object before attempting to access it. This can be done using the in operator, which returns a Boolean value (True or False) depending on whether the key exists. Here's an example:

```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

# Checking if a key exists before accessing it
if 'c' in my_dict:
    print(my_dict['c']) # Doesn't get executed
else:
    print('Key not found') # Prints 'Key not found'
```

## 3. Using try-except blocks

try-except blocks can also be used to catch MultiValueDictKeyError and handle it gracefully. In this case, the code that might raise an error is put inside a try block, while the handling code is put inside an except block. Here's an example:

```python
my_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

try:
    print(my_dict['c']) # Raises KeyError: 'c'
except KeyError:
    print('Key not found') # Prints 'Key not found'
```

## 4. Using the .getlist() method specifically for MultiValueDict

As django MultiValueDict is not exactly `dictionary-like` and contains more than one value against a given key therefore `.get()` function doesn't work for all cases in MultiValueDict. To handle this error with MultiValueDict we have another method called .getlist() which returns a list of all values for a given key in the dictionary. Here's an example:

```python
from django.http import QueryDict

my_dict = QueryDict('a=1&a=2&b=3')

# Using [] operator (raises an error)
print(my_dict['c']) # Raises MultiValueDictKeyError: 'c'

# Using get() method with a default value (returns None)
print(my_dict.get('c')) # Prints None

# Using getlist() to get all values for a key (returns [])
print(my_dict.getlist('c')) # Prints []

```

# Conclusion

MultiValueDictKeyError can be a common error while working with dictionary-like objects in Django, however, by using one of four approaches mentioned above we can handle it accordingly and continue the program execution.
