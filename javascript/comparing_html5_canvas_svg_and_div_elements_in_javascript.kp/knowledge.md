[TOC]

## HTML5 Canvas
HTML5 Canvas is an HTML element that allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images. It is supported by all modern browsers and is used for rendering graphs, game graphics, art, or other visual images on the fly.

## SVG
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics and is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics. SVG images are resolution-independent and can scale to any size without losing quality.

## div
A div is an HTML element that divides the page into sections. It can be used to group elements together, such as images, text, or other HTML elements. It can also be used to create layouts, such as columns and rows.

## Javascript
JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to create interactive webpages. It can be used to manipulate HTML elements, such as divs and canvases, and to create dynamic content. It can also be used to create animations and games.
