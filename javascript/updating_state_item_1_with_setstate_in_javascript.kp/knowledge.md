### 1. Retrieve the Current State

Before updating the state, you need to retrieve the current state object. This can be done by calling the `getState()` method.

### 2. Update the State

Once you have the current state object, you can then update the state by calling the `setState()` method and passing in the new state object.

### 3. Update the Item in the State

You can update the item in the state by accessing the item in the state object and updating the value. For example, if you wanted to update the value of `state.item[1]`, you could do the following:

```javascript
let newState = {...state};
newState.item[1] = 'newValue';
```

### 4. Set the State

Finally, you can set the state by calling the `setState()` method and passing in the new state object. This will update the state with the new item value.
