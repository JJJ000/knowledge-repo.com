#1 Using the Spread Operator

The spread operator is a convenient way to concatenate arrays in Javascript. It takes an array as its argument and expands it into its individual elements, which can then be combined with other arrays. This method is efficient because it does not require looping over the arrays, and it allows for easy manipulation of the resulting array.

#2 Using Array.concat()

The Array.concat() method is another way to concatenate arrays in Javascript. This method takes one or more arrays as arguments and combines them into a single array. This method is efficient because it does not require looping over the arrays and it allows for easy manipulation of the resulting array.

#3 Using Array.prototype.push()

The Array.prototype.push() method is yet another way to concatenate arrays in Javascript. This method takes one or more arrays as arguments and pushes them onto the end of the array. This method is efficient because it does not require looping over the arrays, and it allows for easy manipulation of the resulting array.

#4 Using the forEach() Method

The forEach() method is the last way to concatenate arrays in Javascript. This method takes a callback as its argument, which is then called on each element of the array. This method is efficient because it allows for easy manipulation of the resulting array and it does not require looping over the arrays.
