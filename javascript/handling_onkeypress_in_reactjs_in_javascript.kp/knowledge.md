**Contents**

[TOC]

#### 1. Adding an onKeyPress Event Handler

In React, you can add an event handler to the component where you want to handle the key press.

```js
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleKeyPress = this.handleKeyPress.bind(this);
  }

  handleKeyPress(event) {
    // Handle the key press here
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div tabIndex="0" onKeyPress={this.handleKeyPress}>
        {/* Content Here */}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

#### 2. Accessing the Key Information

The `event` object that is passed to the `handleKeyPress` function contains information about the key that was pressed.

The `event.key` property contains the name of the key that was pressed, and the `event.charCode` property contains the Unicode character code of the key that was pressed.

#### 3. Preventing Default Behaviour

If you want to prevent the default behaviour of the key press (e.g. submitting a form), you can call `event.preventDefault()` in the `handleKeyPress` function.

```js
handleKeyPress(event) {
  event.preventDefault();
  // Handle the key press here
}
```

#### 4. Accessing Other Event Properties

The `event` object also contains other properties that you can access, such as `event.shiftKey` to check if the Shift key was pressed, or `event.target` to get a reference to the element that the event was triggered on.
