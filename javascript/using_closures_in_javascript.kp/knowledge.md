#### Use in Event Handlers
Closures can be used to create event handlers in JavaScript. By using a closure, the event handler can keep track of any variables and functions that were available when the handler was created, even if the context in which it was created is no longer present. This allows the handler to access variables and functions from the outer scope when the event is triggered.

#### Use in Asynchronous Callbacks
Closures can also be used to create asynchronous callbacks in JavaScript. By using a closure, the callback can keep track of any variables and functions that were available when the callback was created, even if the context in which it was created is no longer present. This allows the callback to access variables and functions from the outer scope when the asynchronous operation is completed.

#### Use in Object-Oriented Programming
Closures can also be used to create object-oriented programming in JavaScript. By using a closure, the object can keep track of any variables and functions that were available when the object was created, even if the context in which it was created is no longer present. This allows the object to access variables and functions from the outer scope when the object is used.

#### Use in Modules
Closures can also be used to create modules in JavaScript. By using a closure, the module can keep track of any variables and functions that were available when the module was created, even if the context in which it was created is no longer present. This allows the module to access variables and functions from the outer scope when the module is imported.
