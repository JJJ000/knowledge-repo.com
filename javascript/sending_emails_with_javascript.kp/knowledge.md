# Section 1: Setting up the Email

When sending an email from JavaScript, it is important to set up the email correctly. This includes setting up the recipient, the subject line, and the body of the email.

# Section 2: Creating the Email

Once the email has been set up, the next step is to create the email. This can be done using the `Email.create` method, which takes the recipient, the subject line, and the body of the email as parameters.

# Section 3: Sending the Email

Once the email has been created, it can be sent using the `Email.send` method. This method takes the email object created in the previous step as a parameter, as well as any additional options such as the sender's email address.

# Section 4: Handling Errors

Finally, it is important to handle any errors that may occur when sending the email. This can be done using the `Email.onError` method, which takes a callback function as a parameter. This callback function will be called if an error occurs when sending the email, and can be used to handle the error appropriately.
