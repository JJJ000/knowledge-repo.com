## No

CSS is a styling language and is used to style HTML elements. It is not possible to apply CSS to half of a character in Javascript.

## Alternatives

If you want to style a single character, you can use Unicode characters, which are characters that are encoded with a specific code point. These characters can be styled with CSS, as they are treated as an individual element.

## Examples

For example, if you wanted to style the letter "a" with a different font, you could use the Unicode character U+0061, which is the code point for the letter "a". You could then apply a font-family style to the character using CSS, like so:

```css
.unicode-letter-a {
  font-family: 'MyFont';
}
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, it is not possible to apply CSS to half of a character in Javascript. However, you can use Unicode characters and style them with CSS.
