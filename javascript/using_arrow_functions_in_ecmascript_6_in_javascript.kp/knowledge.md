1. When Working with Promises 

Arrow functions are especially useful when working with promises. They can help you avoid having to explicitly bind the `this` keyword, which can be a source of confusion and errors.

2. When Defining Callbacks 

Arrow functions can be used to define callbacks, which are functions passed as arguments to other functions. This is especially useful when dealing with asynchronous code, since the arrow function preserves the lexical scope of the enclosing context.

3. When Working with Higher-Order Functions 

Higher-order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as their result. Arrow functions can be used to make these higher-order functions more concise and readable.

4. When Working with Array Iteration 

Arrow functions can be used to iterate over arrays and perform operations on each element. This is especially useful when dealing with large datasets, since the arrow function can be used to quickly perform the same operation on each element.
