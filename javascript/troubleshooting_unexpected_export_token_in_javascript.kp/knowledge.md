# Solution

## Overview 
Unexpected token export is a common syntax error in JavaScript. It occurs when the keyword ‘export’ is used outside of a module. This error can be caused by a variety of factors, including incorrect syntax, missing files, or incorrect file types. 

## Causes

1. Incorrect Syntax: One of the most common causes of the unexpected token export error is incorrect syntax. This can happen when the export keyword is used outside of a module or when the syntax of the export statement is incorrect. 

2. Missing Files: Another common cause of the unexpected token export error is missing files. If a file containing an export statement is missing, the error will be thrown. 

3. Incorrect File Types: Finally, the unexpected token export error can also be caused by incorrect file types. If a file containing an export statement is not a JavaScript file, the error will be thrown. 

## Solutions

1. Check Syntax: The first step in solving the unexpected token export error is to check the syntax of the export statement. If the syntax is incorrect, the error can be fixed by correcting it. 

2. Check Files: The second step is to check that all necessary files are present and that the file types are correct. If any files are missing or incorrect, they should be added or corrected. 

3. Use Modules: Finally, if the export statement is being used outside of a module, it should be placed inside a module. This will ensure that the export statement is valid and will prevent the unexpected token export error from occurring.
