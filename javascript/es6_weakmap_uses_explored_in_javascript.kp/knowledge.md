1. Garbage Collection 
WeakMaps are useful for garbage collection because they allow objects to be associated with private data without creating a reference that can interfere with garbage collection. This is because WeakMaps are not enumerable, meaning that they are not included in the list of keys returned by the Object.keys() method.

2. Memory Management 
WeakMaps can help with memory management by allowing objects to be associated with private data without creating a reference that can interfere with garbage collection. This is because WeakMaps are not enumerable, meaning that they are not included in the list of keys returned by the Object.keys() method.

3. Security 
WeakMaps can be used to store sensitive data that is not accessible to the public. This is because WeakMaps are not enumerable, meaning that they are not included in the list of keys returned by the Object.keys() method.

4. Performance 
WeakMaps can improve performance by allowing objects to be associated with private data without creating a reference that can interfere with garbage collection. This is because WeakMaps are not enumerable, meaning that they are not included in the list of keys returned by the Object.keys() method.
