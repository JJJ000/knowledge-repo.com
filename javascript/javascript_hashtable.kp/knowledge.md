**Contents**

1. **Definition:**
A JavaScript hashmap is an object that holds key-value pairs and uses the key to access the associated value. It is an unordered collection of data, similar to an associative array in other languages.

2. **Features:**
- JavaScript hashmaps are dynamic; they can be added to and removed from easily.
- They are also very fast, as the key is used to quickly retrieve the associated value.
- They are also useful for storing data that needs to be accessed quickly.

3. **Example:**
```
let hashmap = {
    key1: "value1",
    key2: "value2"
};

// Accessing a value
let value1 = hashmap.key1; // returns "value1"

// Adding a new key-value pair
hashmap.key3 = "value3";
```

4. **Advantages:**
- JavaScript hashmaps are very fast and efficient for retrieving data.
- They are also easy to use and modify.
- They are also useful for storing large amounts of data.
