tldr: You can check for null values in JavaScript using the strict equality operator (===) to compare a value with null.

## Option 1: The Strict Equality Operator
The strict equality operator (`===`) is used to check for null values in JavaScript. This operator checks for both the value and type of the two operands. If both operands are null, the expression evaluates to true.

## Option 2: The Double Equals Operator
The double equals operator (`==`) is another way to check for null values in JavaScript. This operator checks for only the value of the two operands. If both operands are null, the expression evaluates to true.

## Option 3: The typeof Operator
The typeof operator is used to check the type of a given operand. If the operand is null, the expression evaluates to "object".

## Option 4: The Object.is() Method
The Object.is() method is used to check for null values in JavaScript. This method checks for both the value and type of the two operands. If both operands are null, the expression evaluates to true.
