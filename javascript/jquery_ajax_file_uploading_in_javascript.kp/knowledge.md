1. Overview

jQuery Ajax File Upload is a technique used to upload files to a remote server using the jQuery library. This technique is useful for transferring large files, such as images, videos, and documents, from a local computer to a server. In addition, jQuery Ajax File Upload can be used to upload multiple files in a single request.

2. Setting Up the jQuery Library

The first step in setting up jQuery Ajax File Upload is to include the jQuery library in the HTML document. This is done by adding the following code to the <head> section of the document:

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js"></script>

3. Setting Up the Upload Form

The next step is to create an HTML form that will be used to upload the files. This form should contain an <input> element with the type attribute set to “file”. This element will be used to select the files that will be uploaded.

4. Uploading the Files

Once the form is set up, the jQuery Ajax File Upload can be implemented. This is done by using the jQuery .ajax() method. This method takes an object as an argument, which contains the details of the request. The object should contain the URL of the server, the type of the request, and the data that will be sent to the server. Additionally, the object should contain a success function, which will be called when the request is successful. The success function should contain the code that will be executed when the request is successful.
