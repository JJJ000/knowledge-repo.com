# .JS

.JS files are plain JavaScript files. They contain JavaScript code that can be used to manipulate the DOM, create functions, and more. The code in .JS files is usually written in ES5 or ES6 syntax, and is executed in the browser.

# .JSX

.JSX files are JavaScript files that contain XML-like syntax. This syntax is used to create React components, which are used to create user interfaces. The code in .JSX files is usually written in ES6 syntax, and is compiled by a transpiler (such as Babel) before being executed in the browser.
