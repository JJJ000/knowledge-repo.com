### Step 1: Parse the JSON String

The first step to safely turn a JSON string into an object is to parse the string using the `JSON.parse()` method. This method takes the JSON string as an argument and returns a JavaScript object.

### Step 2: Validate the JSON String

The second step to safely turn a JSON string into an object is to validate the string. This can be done using the `JSON.stringify()` method. This method takes the JavaScript object as an argument and returns a JSON string. If the JSON string returned is the same as the one passed in, then the string is valid.

### Step 3: Catch Syntax Errors

The third step to safely turn a JSON string into an object is to catch any syntax errors. This can be done by wrapping the `JSON.parse()` method in a `try...catch` block. If any syntax errors are encountered, they will be caught and handled in the `catch` block.

### Step 4: Return the Object

The fourth and final step to safely turn a JSON string into an object is to return the object. This can be done by returning the object that is returned by the `JSON.parse()` method. This will ensure that the object is returned safely and without any errors.
