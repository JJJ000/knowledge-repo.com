# Solution

## Overview
When running `npm start` in Javascript, an error may occur if the start script is missing. This error occurs because the `start` script is specified in the `package.json` file and the script is not found in the project.

## Cause
The `start` script is specified in the `package.json` file, which is a configuration file for the project. When running `npm start`, npm looks for a `start` script in the `package.json` file and attempts to execute it. If the `start` script is not found, an error is thrown.

## Resolution
The resolution for this issue is to add a `start` script to the `package.json` file. This can be done by adding the following line to the `scripts` section of the `package.json` file:

```
"start": "node index.js"
```

This specifies that when `npm start` is run, the `index.js` file should be executed. Once the `start` script is added to the `package.json` file, `npm start` should run without any errors.
