### Step 1: Parse the JSON String

The first step to safely turning a JSON string into an object is to parse the string. This can be done using the `JSON.parse()` method. This method takes the JSON string as an argument and returns an object.

### Step 2: Handle Exceptions

When parsing a JSON string, it is important to handle any exceptions that may be thrown. This can be done using a `try/catch` statement. Inside the `try` block, the `JSON.parse()` method can be called on the JSON string. If an exception is thrown, it will be caught in the `catch` block, allowing the program to take the appropriate action.

### Step 3: Access Properties

Once the JSON string has been successfully parsed, the properties of the object can be accessed. This can be done using dot notation or bracket notation.

### Step 4: Validate the Data

The final step is to validate the data that has been parsed from the JSON string. This can be done by checking the type of each property and ensuring that it is what is expected. If the data is not valid, the appropriate action can be taken.
