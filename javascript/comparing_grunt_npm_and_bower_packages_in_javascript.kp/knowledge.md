**Grunt**

Grunt is a JavaScript task runner that automates tedious tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, and linting. Grunt is typically used for web development, but can be used for any project that requires automation.

**NPM**

NPM is a package manager for JavaScript. It is used to install, share, and distribute code, as well as manage dependencies in your projects. NPM is the default package manager for Node.js and is included in most Node.js installations.

**Bower**

Bower is a package manager for the web. It is used to install, update, and manage web development packages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images. Bower is typically used for front-end development.

**package.json vs bower.json**

package.json and bower.json are both configuration files used to manage project dependencies. package.json is used to manage Node.js dependencies, while bower.json is used to manage web development dependencies.
