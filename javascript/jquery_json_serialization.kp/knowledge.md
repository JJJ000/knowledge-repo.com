### Overview 
JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write and for machines to parse and generate. JSON is a text-based, language-independent data format. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language and is commonly used for data interchange in web applications.

### jQuery and JSON 
jQuery is a JavaScript library that simplifies the client-side scripting of HTML. It can be used to access, manipulate, and traverse elements of a web page, as well as handle events, create animations, and develop Ajax applications. jQuery can be used to serialize a JavaScript object into a JSON string. 

### Serializing with jQuery 
jQuery provides the $.toJSON() method for serializing objects into JSON. The method takes a JavaScript object as an argument and returns a JSON string. The $.toJSON() method can be used to serialize a JavaScript object into a JSON string in a few lines of code. 

### Example 
The following example shows how to use the $.toJSON() method to serialize a JavaScript object into a JSON string: 

```javascript
var myObject = {
    name: "John Doe",
    age: 25
};
var jsonString = $.toJSON(myObject);
```

The jsonString variable will contain the following string: 

```json
{"name":"John Doe","age":25}
```
