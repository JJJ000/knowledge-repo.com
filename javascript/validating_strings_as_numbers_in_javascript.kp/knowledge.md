#1 Regex

A simple way to check if a string is a valid number is to use a regular expression (regex). A regex is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, allowing you to match and/or replace strings.

#2 String.prototype.match()

The String.prototype.match() method can be used to check if a string is a valid number. The method takes a regex as an argument and returns an array containing all matches of the regex in the string. If no matches are found, it will return null.

#3 isNaN()

The isNaN() function can be used to check if a string is a valid number. The function takes a value as an argument and returns true if the value is not a number, and false if the value is a number.

#4 Try/Catch

The try/catch statement can be used to check if a string is a valid number. The try/catch statement allows you to test a block of code for errors. If an error is encountered, the catch block is executed. This can be used to check if a string is a valid number by attempting to convert the string to a number and catching any errors that may occur.
