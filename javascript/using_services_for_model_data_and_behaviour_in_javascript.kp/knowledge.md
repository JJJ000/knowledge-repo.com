## Services
Services are the best place to put model data and behaviour in Javascript. Services are essentially classes that contain data and methods that can be accessed from other components. Services are a great way to keep code organized and make it easier to maintain.

## Benefits
Services provide several benefits when it comes to organizing model data and behaviour. Services are easy to maintain since they are separate from other components and can be updated without affecting the rest of the application. They also provide a way to share data and behaviour between components, which can be beneficial when dealing with complex applications.

## Usage
Services are typically used in conjunction with other components such as controllers and directives. For example, a controller might call a service to get data or perform an operation, while a directive might use a service to bind data to the view. Services can also be used to create custom services that can be shared across components.

## Conclusion
Services are a great way to organize model data and behaviour in Javascript. They provide several benefits, including the ability to maintain code more easily and share data and behaviour between components. Services can be used in conjunction with other components to create powerful and reusable applications.
