1. **Check the element's position relative to the viewport**
  
  To determine if an element is visible in the viewport, the first step is to check its position relative to the viewport. This can be done by getting the element's top, right, bottom and left positions relative to the viewport.

2. **Calculate the element's width and height**

  Next, the element's width and height need to be calculated. This can be done by getting the element's offsetWidth and offsetHeight properties.

3. **Compare the element's position to the viewport's boundaries**

  Once the element's position and size have been determined, they can be compared to the viewport's boundaries. If the element is within the viewport's boundaries, then it is visible.

4. **Check for any overlapping elements**

  Finally, it is important to check for any overlapping elements that may be obscuring the element in question. If any elements are overlapping, then the element may not be visible even if it is within the viewport's boundaries.
