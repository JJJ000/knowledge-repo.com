#### Map
A Map is a collection of key/value pairs, where the keys are unique. It is an unordered collection of data. It is similar to an Object, but the main difference is that the keys of a Map can be any data type, such as a String, Number, or Object.

#### Object
An Object is a collection of key/value pairs, where the keys are strings. It is an ordered collection of data. It is similar to a Map, but the main difference is that the keys of an Object must be strings.
