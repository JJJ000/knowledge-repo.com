### Benefits

SetTimeout(fn, 0) is useful in Javascript because it allows code to be executed asynchronously. This means that code can be run without blocking the main thread, allowing the browser to continue to process other tasks. This is especially useful in cases where code needs to be executed after a certain amount of time, such as in a timer or when waiting for a response from an API.

### Improved Performance

Using SetTimeout(fn, 0) can also help improve performance. Since the code is executed asynchronously, the main thread is not blocked and can continue to process other tasks. This can help improve the overall performance of the application by allowing it to process tasks in parallel.

### Limitations

SetTimeout(fn, 0) does have some limitations. Since the code is executed asynchronously, it can be difficult to track the order in which tasks are executed. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential bugs. Additionally, the code may not always execute in the same order as it was written, which can also lead to unexpected results.
