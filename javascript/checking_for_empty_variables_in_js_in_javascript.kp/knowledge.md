### Explanation

There is no standard JavaScript function that can be used to check for null, undefined, or blank variables. However, there are a few ways to check for these conditions.

### Checking for Null

The most common way to check for a null value is to use the `==` or `===` operator. The `==` operator will check for both null and undefined values, while the `===` operator will only check for null values.

### Checking for Undefined

The `typeof` operator can be used to check for undefined values. If the value is undefined, the `typeof` operator will return `undefined`.

### Checking for Blank

The most common way to check for a blank value is to use the `trim()` method. This method will remove any leading and trailing whitespace from a string, and if the string is empty after trimming, it can be considered blank.
