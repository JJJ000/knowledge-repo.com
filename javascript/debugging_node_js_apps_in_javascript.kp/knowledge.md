## Step 1: Set Breakpoints

The first step in debugging a Node.js application is to set breakpoints. This can be done by adding the keyword “debugger” to the code at the point where you want to pause the execution and inspect the state of the program.

## Step 2: Start the Debugging Session

Once the breakpoints have been set, the next step is to start the debugging session. This can be done by running the Node.js application with the “debug” flag. For example, if the application is called “myapp.js”, then it can be started with the following command:

```
node debug myapp.js
```

## Step 3: Execute Commands

Once the debugging session has been started, the next step is to execute commands. This can be done by using the “repl” command, which stands for “read-eval-print loop”. This command allows the user to execute JavaScript code and inspect the state of the program.

## Step 4: Examine the Stack Trace

The last step in debugging a Node.js application is to examine the stack trace. This can be done by using the “backtrace” command, which will show the call stack at the point where the debugger was paused. This can be used to pinpoint the source of the issue and to identify any potential bugs.
