## Introduction

The challenge of creating a dynamic width and height in CSS is a common problem faced by web developers. Achieving a fluid layout can be difficult, especially when dealing with dynamic content. In this article, we will discuss how to create an equal width and height using CSS and JavaScript.

## Flexbox

Flexbox is a powerful tool for creating responsive layouts. It allows you to create a flexible container that can expand or shrink depending on the size of its contents. When using flexbox, you can set the width and height of the container to be equal by setting the flex-direction property to “row”. This will ensure that the width and height of the container will always be equal.

## Media Queries

Media queries are a powerful tool for creating responsive layouts. They allow you to specify different styles for different screen sizes. This can be used to create a fluid layout by setting the width and height of the container to be equal for different screen sizes.

## Conclusion

Creating a dynamic width and height in CSS can be a challenging task. However, using flexbox and media queries, it is possible to create an equal width and height for different screen sizes. This can be used to create a fluid layout that will adapt to the size of the user’s device.
