tldr: Using prototype allows for methods to be shared among all instances of an object, resulting in less memory usage and improved performance.

1. Increased Performance:
Using the prototype to define methods for an object can lead to improved performance as the prototype is only created once. When the constructor is called, the methods are already defined on the prototype and do not need to be redefined each time. This can lead to improved performance as the same code does not need to be re-run each time the constructor is called.

2. Reduced Memory Usage:
Defining methods on the prototype can also reduce memory usage as the methods are only stored once. When the constructor is called, the methods are already defined on the prototype and do not need to be stored in memory each time. This can lead to reduced memory usage as the same methods are not stored multiple times.

3. Improved Readability:
Using the prototype to define methods can also improve readability as the methods are defined separately from the constructor. This can make the code easier to read and understand as the methods are not cluttered with the constructor code.

4. Easier to Maintain:
Defining methods on the prototype can also make the code easier to maintain as the methods are separate from the constructor code. This can make it easier to modify and debug the code as the methods are not cluttered with the constructor code.
