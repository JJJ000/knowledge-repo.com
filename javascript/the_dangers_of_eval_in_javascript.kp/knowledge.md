[TOC]

#### Security Risk

Using the JavaScript eval function can be a security risk because it allows malicious code to be executed in the global scope, which can be used to gain access to sensitive information and perform malicious actions.

#### Performance

Using the JavaScript eval function can negatively impact performance. Evaluating code with eval is much slower than running the same code without it, as eval has to parse the code and then execute it, which takes more time than simply executing the code.

#### Debugging

Using the JavaScript eval function can make debugging code more difficult. Since eval executes code in the global scope, it can be difficult to track down where the code is being executed and what variables are being used.

#### Maintenance

Using the JavaScript eval function can make code maintenance more difficult. Evaluating code with eval can make the code more difficult to read and understand, making it harder to maintain in the future.
