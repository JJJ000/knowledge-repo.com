tldr: Using Node.JS, you can read a JSON file into memory by using the fs module`s readFileSync() method.

# Section 1: Import the File System Module

The first step is to import the File System (fs) module. The fs module is part of the Node.js core library and provides an API for interacting with the file system.

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
```

# Section 2: Read the File

Once the fs module is imported, you can use the readFile() method to read the contents of the JSON file. The readFile() method takes two arguments: the path to the file, and a callback function. The callback function is called once the file is read.

```javascript
fs.readFile('./path/to/file.json', (err, data) => {
  if (err) throw err;
});
```

# Section 3: Parse the File

Once the file is read, the data must be parsed into a JavaScript object. This can be done using the JSON.parse() method. The JSON.parse() method takes a string as an argument and returns a JavaScript object.

```javascript
const jsonData = JSON.parse(data);
```

# Section 4: Access the Data

Once the data is parsed, you can access the data in the object using dot notation.

```javascript
console.log(jsonData.name); // Outputs the value of the "name" property
```
