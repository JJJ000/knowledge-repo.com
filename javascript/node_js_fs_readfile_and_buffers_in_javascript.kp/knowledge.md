#### Benefits of Buffers

Buffers are more efficient than strings when dealing with binary data. They are also more memory-efficient, as they do not require additional memory allocations when dealing with large amounts of data. Additionally, they are faster to process than strings, as they can be directly manipulated without having to create intermediary objects.

#### Disadvantages of Strings

Strings are less efficient when dealing with binary data, as they require additional memory allocations to store the data. Additionally, strings are slower to process than buffers, as they must first be converted into intermediary objects before they can be manipulated.

#### Advantages of fs.readFile()

fs.readFile() allows for the efficient manipulation of binary data. By returning a buffer, it eliminates the need for additional memory allocations and intermediary objects, resulting in faster processing times. Additionally, fs.readFile() can be used to read files from the file system, eliminating the need to manually open and close files.

#### Summary

In summary, Node.js' fs.readFile() returns a buffer instead of a string because it is more efficient and memory-efficient when dealing with binary data. Additionally, it eliminates the need for additional memory allocations and intermediary objects, resulting in faster processing times.
