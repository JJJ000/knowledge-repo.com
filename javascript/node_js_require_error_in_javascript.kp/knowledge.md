### Section 1: Overview

The "Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined" error occurs when the `require()` function is used in a JavaScript file without first requiring the `require` module. The `require` module is used to import other modules and files into the current file.

### Section 2: Causes

This error is typically caused by attempting to use the `require()` function without first requiring the `require` module. The `require` module is used to import other modules and files into the current file. Without requiring the `require` module, the `require()` function will be undefined and an error will be thrown.

### Section 3: Solutions

The solution to this error is to ensure that the `require` module is required before any other modules or files. This can be done by adding the following line of code to the top of the JavaScript file:

```javascript
const require = require('require');
```

### Section 4: Conclusion

By ensuring that the `require` module is required before any other modules or files, the "Uncaught ReferenceError: require is not defined" error can be avoided. This will allow the `require()` function to be used without any errors.
