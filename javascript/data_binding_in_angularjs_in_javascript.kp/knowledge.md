#### Overview

Data binding in AngularJS is the synchronization of data between the model and view components. It allows for the automatic synchronization of data between the model and view components, making it easier to keep the two components in sync. The model is the data source, and the view is the user interface. Data binding can be used to bind data from the model to the view, or from the view to the model.

#### Model to View

When data binding is used to bind data from the model to the view, the model is the source of truth. Any changes to the model will be automatically reflected in the view. For example, if the model is updated with a new value, the view will be updated with the new value. This is known as one-way data binding.

#### View to Model

When data binding is used to bind data from the view to the model, the view is the source of truth. Any changes to the view will be automatically reflected in the model. For example, if the user enters a new value in a form, the model will be updated with the new value. This is known as two-way data binding.

#### Summary

Data binding in AngularJS is the synchronization of data between the model and view components. It allows for the automatic synchronization of data between the two components, making it easier to keep the two components in sync. Data binding can be used to bind data from the model to the view, or from the view to the model. This makes it easier to keep the model and view in sync, as changes to either component will be automatically reflected in the other.
