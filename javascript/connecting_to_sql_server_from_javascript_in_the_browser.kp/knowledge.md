## Establishing a Connection

In order to establish a connection to a SQL Server database from JavaScript, we need to use a server-side language such as Node.js to create a connection to the database. We can use a library such as mssql or tedious to create the connection. 

## Setting up the Database

We need to make sure that the database is set up properly before we can connect to it from JavaScript. We need to create a user account with permission to access the database, create a database, and set up the necessary tables. 

## Writing the JavaScript Code

Once the database is set up, we can write the JavaScript code to connect to the database. We can use the mssql or tedious library to create the connection and then use SQL statements to query the database and get the data we need. 

## Testing the Connection

Once the JavaScript code is written, we can test the connection by running the code and checking the results. If the connection is successful, we should be able to query the database and get the expected results.
