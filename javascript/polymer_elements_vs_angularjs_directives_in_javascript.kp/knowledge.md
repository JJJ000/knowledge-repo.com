#### Polymer Elements
Polymer elements are HTML elements that are created using Polymer. They are custom elements that have their own behavior and properties. They are reusable components that can be used to create complex web applications. They are also self-contained and have their own state and logic.

#### AngularJS Directives
AngularJS directives are custom HTML attributes that are used to extend HTML elements. They are used to create custom HTML tags and attributes that can be used to add new behavior to existing elements. They are also used to create reusable components that can be used to create complex web applications. Unlike Polymer elements, they are not self-contained and rely on the scope of the application to access data and logic.
