**Accessing Nested Objects**

Nested objects are objects that are inside other objects. To access a nested object, you need to use the dot notation or bracket notation. The dot notation is used when the property name is known and it consists of the object name followed by a dot and the name of the property. The bracket notation is used when the property name is unknown or contains special characters, and it consists of the object name followed by a bracket and the name of the property in quotes.

**Processing Nested Arrays**

Nested arrays are arrays that contain other arrays. To process a nested array, you can use the Array.map() method to iterate over each element in the array and return a new array with the desired elements. You can also use the Array.reduce() method to iterate over each element in the array and return a single value.

**Accessing and Processing Nested JSON**

Nested JSON is JSON that contains other JSON objects or arrays. To access a nested JSON object, you can use the dot notation or bracket notation. To process a nested JSON object, you can use the JSON.parse() method to convert the JSON string into a JavaScript object, and then use the for...in loop to iterate over each property of the object.

**Processing Nested Objects**

To process a nested object, you can use the for...in loop to iterate over each property of the object. You can also use the Object.keys() method to get an array of all the keys in the object, and then use the Array.map() method to iterate over each element in the array and return a new object with the desired properties.
