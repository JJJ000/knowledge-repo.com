1. **Gather Data**

Before attempting to group an array of objects by key, the array must first be obtained. This can be done by creating a new array or by accessing an existing array. 

2. **Iterate Through Array**

Once an array of objects has been obtained, it can be iterated through using a loop. A `for` loop is often used for this purpose, as it allows for the array to be iterated through with ease. 

3. **Group Objects By Key**

When iterating through the array, each object can be grouped by the desired key. For example, if the key is “name”, the objects can be grouped by the value of the “name” key. This can be done by creating a new object with the key being the “name” value and the value being an array of all the objects with the same “name” value. 

4. **Return Grouped Objects**

Once the objects have been grouped by key, the grouped objects can be returned. This can be done by simply returning the newly created object.
