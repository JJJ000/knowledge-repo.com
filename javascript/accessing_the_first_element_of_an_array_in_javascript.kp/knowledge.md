[TOC]

# Section 1: Accessing the First Element

The first element of an array in Javascript can be accessed by using the index of 0. This is because arrays are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on.

# Section 2: Syntax

To access the first element of an array, the syntax is as follows:

```
arrayName[0]
```

# Section 3: Example

For example, if we have an array called `myArray` with three elements, we can access the first element like this:

```
let myArray = ["a", "b", "c"];
let firstElement = myArray[0]; // firstElement is now "a"
```

# Section 4: Conclusion

In conclusion, the first element of an array in Javascript can be accessed by using the index of 0. The syntax for accessing the first element is `arrayName[0]`.
