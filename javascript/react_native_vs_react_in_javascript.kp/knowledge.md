# React
React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It is used for creating single-page applications and is maintained by Facebook. React helps developers create large web applications that can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple.

# React Native
React Native is a mobile framework that compiles to native app components, allowing you to build native mobile applications (iOS, Android, and Windows) in JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components. React Native also taps into the capabilities of the underlying platform, giving you access to native components such as camera, geolocation, and more.
