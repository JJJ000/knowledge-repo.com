# Section 1: Using the Object.keys() Method
The Object.keys() method can be used to get the size of a JavaScript object. This method returns an array containing the names of all the enumerable properties of the given object. The length of this array is equal to the size of the object.

# Section 2: Using the Object.getOwnPropertyNames() Method
The Object.getOwnPropertyNames() method can be used to get the size of a JavaScript object. This method returns an array containing the names of all the properties of the given object, including non-enumerable properties. The length of this array is equal to the size of the object.

# Section 3: Using the for...in Loop
The for...in loop can be used to get the size of a JavaScript object. This loop iterates over all the enumerable properties of the given object and the number of iterations is equal to the size of the object.

# Section 4: Using the JSON.stringify() Method
The JSON.stringify() method can be used to get the size of a JavaScript object. This method returns a JSON string representation of the given object. The length of this string is equal to the size of the object.
