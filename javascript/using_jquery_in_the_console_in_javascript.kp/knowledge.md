# Section 1: Download jQuery

The first step to include jQuery in the JavaScript Console is to download the jQuery library. This can be done by going to the [jQuery website](https://jquery.com/download/) and selecting the version you need.

# Section 2: Include jQuery in HTML

Once the jQuery library is downloaded, it must be included in the HTML file. This can be done by using the `<script>` tag and placing the downloaded jQuery library in the `src` attribute.

# Section 3: Access jQuery in JavaScript

Once the jQuery library is included in the HTML file, it can be accessed in the JavaScript file. This is done by creating a `<script>` tag in the HTML file and referencing the JavaScript file.

# Section 4: Use jQuery in JavaScript Console

Once the jQuery library is included and accessible in the JavaScript file, it can be used in the JavaScript Console. This is done by typing `$` in the console and then typing any jQuery methods or functions.
