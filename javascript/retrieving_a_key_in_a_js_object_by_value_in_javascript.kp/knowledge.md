#1. Using for Loop

One way to get a key in a JavaScript object by its value is to use a `for` loop. This approach involves looping through the object's properties and checking if the value of each property is equal to the value we are looking for. If a match is found, the corresponding key is returned.

```javascript
function getKeyByValue(object, value) {
  for (var key in object) {
    if (object[key] === value) {
      return key;
    }
  }
  return null;
}
```

#2. Using Object.keys()

Another way to get a key in a JavaScript object by its value is to use the `Object.keys()` method. This method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names. We can then use the `Array.prototype.find()` method to find the key associated with the given value.

```javascript
function getKeyByValue(object, value) {
  return Object.keys(object).find(key => object[key] === value);
}
```

#3. Using Object.entries()

A third way to get a key in a JavaScript object by its value is to use the `Object.entries()` method. This method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property [key, value] pairs. We can then use the `Array.prototype.find()` method to find the key associated with the given value.

```javascript
function getKeyByValue(object, value) {
  return Object.entries(object).find(([key, val]) => val === value)[0];
}
```

#4. Using Array.prototype.find()

A fourth way to get a key in a JavaScript object by its value is to use the `Array.prototype.find()` method. This method returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. We can use this method to loop through the object's properties and find the key associated with the given value.

```javascript
function getKeyByValue(object, value) {
  return Object.keys(object).find(key => object[key] === value);
}
```
