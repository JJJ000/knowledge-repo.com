### What is Const?
Const is a keyword in JavaScript that is used to declare a constant. A constant is an immutable value that cannot be changed once declared. Constants are declared using the const keyword followed by the name of the constant and the value.

### When to Use Const
Const should be used when you need to create a value that will not change. This is useful for declaring variables such as PI or other mathematical constants. Constants are also useful when declaring values that will be used throughout a program such as a connection string or a URL. 

### Is it Necessary in Javascript?
No, const is not necessary in JavaScript. You can use the let or var keyword to declare variables that can be changed. However, using const can help to improve the readability of your code and can help to prevent accidental changes to the value of a variable.
