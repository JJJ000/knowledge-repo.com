## What is Middleware?
Middleware is a layer of code that sits between two applications. It is used to modify, process and route data between them. It is an intermediary which allows the two applications to communicate and exchange data.

## What is Async Flow?
Async flow is a programming technique that allows for asynchronous operations to be performed in a specific order. It is often used in applications where multiple requests need to be made in a specific order, such as when fetching data from an API.

## Why Do We Need Middleware for Async Flow in Redux?
Redux is a state management library for JavaScript that is used to manage the state of an application. It is designed to be predictable and consistent, and it relies on synchronous code to work properly. Asynchronous code, however, can cause issues with Redux, as it can cause the state to change unpredictably. This is where middleware comes in. By using middleware, developers can ensure that asynchronous operations are performed in the correct order and that the state remains consistent.

## Benefits of Using Middleware for Async Flow in Redux
Using middleware for async flow in Redux provides a number of benefits. It allows for asynchronous operations to be performed in a specific order, which can help to improve the performance of an application. It also ensures that the state remains consistent, which helps to reduce the risk of bugs and errors. Finally, it allows for code reuse, as the same middleware can be used across multiple applications.
