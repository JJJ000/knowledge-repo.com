[TOC]

#1: Create a JavaScript Object

Create a JavaScript object that contains the data you would like to pass to the Web API. The object should have the same structure as the object that the Web API expects.

#2: Stringify the Object

Stringify the JavaScript object using the JSON.stringify() method. This will convert the object into a string of JSON data.

#3: Pass the JSON Data to the Web API

Pass the JSON data to the Web API using an AJAX call. Set the content type of the request to “application/json”.

#4: Deserialize the JSON Data

On the server side, deserialize the JSON data using the appropriate library. This will convert the JSON string into an object that can be used within the Web API.
