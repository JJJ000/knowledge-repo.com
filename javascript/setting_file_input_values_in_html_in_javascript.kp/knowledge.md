1. Create the File Input Element

To set a value to a file input in HTML using Javascript, the first step is to create the file input element. This can be done by using the `<input>` tag with the type attribute set to `file`.

2. Set the Value of the File Input

Once the file input element has been created, the value of the file input can be set by using the `value` property. This can be done by assigning a string representing the file path to the value property.

3. Add the File to the File Input Element

Finally, the file can be added to the file input element by using the `files` property. This can be done by assigning a `FileList` object containing the file to the `files` property.

4. Submit the Form

Once the file input element is populated with the desired file, the form containing the file input element can be submitted. This can be done by using the `submit()` method on the `<form>` element.
