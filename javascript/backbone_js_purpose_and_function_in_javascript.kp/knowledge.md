## Overview
Backbone.js is a JavaScript library that provides structure to web applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions, views with declarative event handling, and connects it all to your existing API over a RESTful JSON interface.

## Models
Backbone.js models provide the basic data structure for the application, allowing developers to store and retrieve data with ease. Models are the fundamental building blocks of any Backbone.js application and are used to represent the data in the application. Models have key-value binding and custom events that allow developers to easily keep track of changes in the application's data.

## Views
Backbone.js views provide the user interface for the application and are responsible for rendering the data stored in the models. Views are responsible for handling user input and responding to user actions. Views also provide the declarative event handling that allows developers to easily bind user actions to specific application events.

## Connectivity
Backbone.js provides a RESTful JSON interface that allows developers to easily connect the application to a backend data store. This allows developers to easily access and manipulate data from the backend without having to write complex code.
