tldr: You can clone an array of objects in JavaScript by using the spread operator (...) or the Array.from() method.

### Using the Spread Operator

The spread operator (`...`) can be used to create a shallow copy of an array of objects. The spread operator is used to spread the elements of the array into individual elements. This will create a new array with the same elements as the original array.

Example:
```javascript
let arr = [{a:1}, {b:2}, {c:3}];
let cloneArr = [...arr];
```

### Using Array.slice()

The `Array.slice()` method can be used to create a shallow copy of an array of objects. This method takes two arguments: the starting index and the ending index. By passing `0` as the starting index and `arr.length` as the ending index, we can create a new array that contains all of the elements from the original array.

Example:
```javascript
let arr = [{a:1}, {b:2}, {c:3}];
let cloneArr = arr.slice(0, arr.length);
```

### Using Array.map()

The `Array.map()` method can also be used to create a shallow copy of an array of objects. This method takes a callback function as an argument and returns a new array with the results of the callback function applied to each element of the original array. By passing an identity function as the callback, we can create a new array that contains all of the elements from the original array.

Example:
```javascript
let arr = [{a:1}, {b:2}, {c:3}];
let cloneArr = arr.map(x => x);
```

### Using JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify()

The `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` methods can be used to create a deep copy of an array of objects. The `JSON.stringify()` method takes an object as an argument and returns a JSON string representation of the object. The `JSON.parse()` method takes a JSON string as an argument and returns an object. By passing the original array as an argument to `JSON.stringify()` and then passing the returned JSON string as an argument to `JSON.parse()`, we can create a new array that contains all of the elements from the original array.

Example:
```javascript
let arr = [{a:1}, {b:2}, {c:3}];
let cloneArr = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(arr));
```
