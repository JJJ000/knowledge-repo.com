tldr: No, JavaScript does not have an interface type like Java`s `interface`.

**No**

### Reasons

1. JavaScript does not have a concept of interfaces as a language feature.
2. JavaScript is a dynamic, interpreted language, so it does not need to adhere to the same type of strict type checking that Java does.
3. JavaScript does not have the same type of compilation process that Java does, so it does not need to use interfaces to enforce type safety.
4. JavaScript is an object-oriented language, so it uses objects and prototypal inheritance to achieve the same functionality that interfaces provide in Java.
