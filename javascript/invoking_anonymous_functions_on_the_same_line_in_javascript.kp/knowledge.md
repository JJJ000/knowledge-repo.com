### Advantages
Anonymous functions provide a number of advantages when invoked on the same line in Javascript. First, they allow for code to be written and executed without having to create a named function. This can be useful for quickly executing a small piece of code without having to create a named function that may never be used again. Secondly, anonymous functions can be useful for creating closures, which can be used to create private variables and functions that are inaccessible from outside of the closure. 

### Syntax
Anonymous functions are written in the same syntax as named functions, but without a name. The syntax for an anonymous function is as follows: 
```
(function(){
    // code to be executed
})();
```
The function is immediately invoked by the parentheses at the end of the function definition. 

### Benefits
Invoking an anonymous function on the same line can also provide a number of benefits. For example, it allows for code to be written and executed without having to create a named function, which can save time and reduce clutter in the codebase. Additionally, anonymous functions can be used to create closures, which can be used to create private variables and functions that are inaccessible from outside of the closure. This can be useful for keeping sensitive information secure. 

### Disadvantages
One of the main disadvantages of using an anonymous function on the same line is that it can be difficult to debug. Since the function is not named, it can be difficult to identify which part of the code is causing an issue. Additionally, since the function is immediately invoked, it can be difficult to step through the code and identify the source of the problem.
