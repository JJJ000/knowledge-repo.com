### Using Splice

The `splice()` method can be used to replace a character at a particular index in a string. It takes in three arguments: the index of the character to be replaced, the number of characters to be replaced, and the character to be used as a replacement.

```javascript
let str = "Hello World!";
let index = 6;
let character = "J";

str = str.splice(index, 1, character);

console.log(str); // "Hello Jorld!"
```

### Using Substring

The `substring()` method can also be used to replace a character at a particular index in a string. It takes in two arguments: the index of the character to be replaced, and the character to be used as a replacement.

```javascript
let str = "Hello World!";
let index = 6;
let character = "J";

str = str.substring(0, index) + character + str.substring(index + 1);

console.log(str); // "Hello Jorld!"
```

### Using Replace

The `replace()` method can also be used to replace a character at a particular index in a string. It takes in two arguments: the character to be replaced, and the character to be used as a replacement.

```javascript
let str = "Hello World!";
let character = "J";

str = str.replace(str[6], character);

console.log(str); // "Hello Jorld!"
```

### Using Array

The `Array()` method can also be used to replace a character at a particular index in a string. It takes in two arguments: the index of the character to be replaced, and the character to be used as a replacement.

```javascript
let str = "Hello World!";
let index = 6;
let character = "J";

let arr = str.split("");
arr[index] = character;
str = arr.join("");

console.log(str); // "Hello Jorld!"
```
