## Using toString

The easiest way to convert an integer to binary in JavaScript is to use the `toString()` method. This method takes two arguments, the first being the base to which the number should be converted and the second being the precision. To convert to binary, the first argument should be set to `2`.

```js
let num = 15;
let binary = num.toString(2);
console.log(binary); // prints "1111"
```

## Using Bitwise Operators

Another way to convert an integer to binary in JavaScript is to use bitwise operators. Bitwise operators can be used to isolate and manipulate the individual bits of a number. By shifting the bits and using the bitwise AND operator, we can create a binary representation of the number.

```js
let num = 15;
let binary = "";
while (num > 0) {
  binary = (num & 1) + binary;
  num = num >> 1;
}
console.log(binary); // prints "1111"
```

## Using a Lookup Table

A third way to convert an integer to binary in JavaScript is to use a lookup table. This method requires creating an array that maps each decimal number to its binary representation. This array can then be used to look up the binary representation of any given number.

```js
// Create a lookup table of binary representations
let lookupTable = [
  "0000",
  "0001",
  "0010",
  "0011",
  "0100",
  "0101",
  "0110",
  "0111",
  "1000",
  "1001",
  "1010",
  "1011",
  "1100",
  "1101",
  "1110",
  "1111"
];

// Look up the binary representation
let num = 15;
let binary = lookupTable[num];
console.log(binary); // prints "1111"
```

## Using a Function

Finally, a fourth way to convert an integer to binary in JavaScript is to use a custom function. This method requires creating a function that takes a number as an argument and returns its binary representation. This is a more complex approach, but it offers more flexibility and control over the conversion process.

```js
// Create a function to convert to binary
function intToBinary(num) {
  let binary = "";
  while (num > 0) {
    binary = (num & 1) + binary;
    num = num >> 1;
  }
  return binary;
}

// Use the function to convert to binary
let num = 15;
let binary = intToBinary(num);
console.log(binary); // prints "1111"
```
