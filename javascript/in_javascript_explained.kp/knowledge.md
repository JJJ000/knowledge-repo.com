[TOC]

## What is "!--"?
"!--" is a comment syntax in JavaScript. It is used to create comments in the code. Comments are used to explain code and make it easier to read and understand.

## How Does "!--" Work?
"!--" is used to start a comment. Anything that comes after the "!--" will be ignored by the interpreter. The comment will end at the end of the line. For example:

```
// This is a single-line comment

/* This is a
multi-line comment */
```

## What Is the Purpose of "!--"?
The purpose of "!--" is to provide a way for developers to add comments to their code. Comments help to explain what the code is doing and make it easier to read and understand.

## When Should "!--" Be Used?
"!--" should be used when adding comments to code. It should not be used as part of the code itself. Comments should be used to explain code, not to write code.
