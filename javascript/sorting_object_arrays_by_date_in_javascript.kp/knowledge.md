# Section 1: Understanding the Problem

The problem is to sort an object array by date property in Javascript.

# Section 2: Exploring Solutions

There are several solutions to this problem. One solution is to use the Array.prototype.sort() method. This method takes a compare function as an argument, which is used to determine the order of the elements. The compare function should take two arguments (a, b) and return a negative number if a should appear before b, a positive number if a should appear after b, and 0 if they are equal.

# Section 3: Implementing the Solution

To implement this solution, first create a compare function that takes two objects from the array as arguments and compares their date properties. For example:

```javascript
function compareDates(a, b) {
  const dateA = new Date(a.date);
  const dateB = new Date(b.date);
  return dateA - dateB;
}
```

Then, use the Array.prototype.sort() method, passing in the compare function as an argument:

```javascript
const sortedArray = array.sort(compareDates);
```

# Section 4: Testing the Solution

Finally, test the solution to make sure it is working as expected. Create a test array of objects with date properties, and then sort the array using the compare function. Then, verify that the array is sorted correctly by checking the dates of the elements in the array.
