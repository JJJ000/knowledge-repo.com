## Stack

A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure, meaning that the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed.

In JavaScript, a stack can be implemented using an array. Every time an element is added to the stack, it is pushed to the end of the array. When an element is removed from the stack, it is popped from the end of the array.

## Queue

A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure, meaning that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.

In JavaScript, a queue can be implemented using an array. Every time an element is added to the queue, it is pushed to the beginning of the array. When an element is removed from the queue, it is shifted from the beginning of the array.
