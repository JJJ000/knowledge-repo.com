# Section 1: Installing the Plugin

The first step to managing jQuery plugin dependency in webpack is to install the plugin. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:

`npm install jquery-plugin-name`

# Section 2: Configuring the Plugin

Once the plugin has been installed, it must be configured in order to be used in webpack. This can be done by adding the following code to the webpack configuration file:

`const jqueryPluginName = require('jquery-plugin-name');`

# Section 3: Using the Plugin

Once the plugin has been configured, it can be used in the application. This can be done by adding the following code to the appropriate file:

`$('selector').jqueryPluginName(options);`

# Section 4: Managing Dependencies

Finally, it is important to manage the plugin's dependencies in order to ensure that the application is functioning correctly. This can be done by adding the following code to the webpack configuration file:

`module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      jqueryPluginName: 'jquery-plugin-name/dist/jquery-plugin-name.min.js'
    }
  }
};`
