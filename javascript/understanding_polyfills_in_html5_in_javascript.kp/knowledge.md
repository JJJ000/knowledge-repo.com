### Definition

Polyfills are pieces of code (usually JavaScript) used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.

### Usage

Polyfills are used to fill in the gaps for features that the browser does not natively support, allowing developers to use the same code for all browsers. This makes development easier and faster, and ensures that the website or web application works across all browsers.

### Benefits

Using polyfills helps to ensure that a website or web application works on all browsers, regardless of their native support for certain features. This helps to improve the user experience and ensures that the website or web application is accessible to all users. Additionally, polyfills can help to improve the performance of a website or web application by using code that is optimized for the browser.
