[TOC]

# Section 1: Install ESLint

1. Install ESLint as a development dependency in your project:

```
npm install eslint --save-dev
```

2. Create a configuration file for ESLint. This can be done either manually or using the command line tool:

```
./node_modules/.bin/eslint --init
```

# Section 2: Configure ESLint

1. Open the configuration file created in the previous step and configure the linting rules.

2. Add the following configuration to enable Jest support:

```
"env": {
  "jest": true
}
```

# Section 3: Run ESLint

1. Run ESLint with the following command:

```
./node_modules/.bin/eslint <path_to_file>
```

2. ESLint will then analyze the code and report any linting errors.

# Section 4: Automate ESLint

1. Add a script to the project's package.json file to automate the linting process:

```
"scripts": {
  "lint": "eslint <path_to_file>"
}
```

2. Run the script with the following command:

```
npm run lint
```
