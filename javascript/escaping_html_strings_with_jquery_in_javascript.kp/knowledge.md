# Section 1: Introduction

Escaping HTML strings is an important part of web development. It helps protect against malicious code injection, which can be used to compromise the security of a website. jQuery is a popular JavaScript library that provides a range of features for manipulating HTML strings. This article will explain how to use jQuery to escape HTML strings in JavaScript.

# Section 2: jQuery API

jQuery provides an API for escaping HTML strings. This API is called the jQuery.escapeSelector() method. This method takes a string as an argument and returns an escaped version of the string. The escaped version of the string is safe to use in HTML contexts, as it will not be interpreted as HTML by the browser.

# Section 3: Example

To illustrate how to use the jQuery.escapeSelector() method, consider the following example. Suppose we have a string containing some HTML tags:

```
let htmlString = "<div>Hello World!</div>";
```

We can use the jQuery.escapeSelector() method to escape this string, as follows:

```
let escapedString = $.escapeSelector(htmlString);
```

The escapedString variable now contains the escaped version of the HTML string:

```
escapedString = "\\<div\\>Hello World!\\</div\\>";
```

# Section 4: Conclusion

In this article, we have discussed how to use jQuery to escape HTML strings in JavaScript. We have seen how to use the jQuery.escapeSelector() method to safely escape HTML strings for use in HTML contexts. Escaping HTML strings is an important part of web development, and jQuery provides an easy way to do it.
