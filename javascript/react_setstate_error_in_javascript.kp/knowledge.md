tldr: The setState method is a part of the React component API and cannot be called directly in plain JavaScript.

### Overview

This.setState is a method used in React components to update the state of a component and trigger a re-render of the component. When this.setState is called, it will update the component's state and trigger a re-render of the component. However, if this.setState is called outside of a React component, it will throw an error saying "this.setState is not a function".

### Causes

The main cause of this error is that this.setState is not a function outside of a React component. This.setState is a method that is only available within React components, and it is not available in the global scope.

### Solutions

In order to solve this error, the code must be restructured so that this.setState is only called within a React component. This can be done by either creating a React component or by using a function that is passed as a parameter to the React component. This will ensure that this.setState is only called within the scope of a React component.

### Conclusion

This.setState is not a function in Javascript, but it can be used within a React component to update the state of a component and trigger a re-render of the component. In order to avoid this error, the code must be restructured so that this.setState is only called within a React component.
