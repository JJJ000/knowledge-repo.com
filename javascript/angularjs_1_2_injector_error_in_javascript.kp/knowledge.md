# What is $injector:modulerr?

$injector:modulerr is an error that occurs when the $injector service is unable to load a module. This error can occur when the module definition is incorrect or when the module has not been loaded correctly.

# How to Resolve $injector:modulerr?

To resolve the $injector:modulerr error, the module definition must be checked to ensure that it is correct. Additionally, the module must be loaded correctly. This can be done by ensuring that the module is included in the application's module array and that the module is included in the application's script file.
