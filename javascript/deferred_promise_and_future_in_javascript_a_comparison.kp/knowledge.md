tldr: Deferred is a promise-like object for asynchronous operations, Promise is an object representing an asynchronous operation, and Future is an object that provides a way to register callbacks to be called when the asynchronous operation is completed.

## Deferred

Deferred is an object that can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or asynchronous function. It allows for the registration of multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or asynchronous function. Deferred objects are used to represent an operation that will complete at some point in the future.

## Promise

Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. It is used to represent a value that will eventually be available, and allows for the chaining of multiple asynchronous operations. Promises can be used to simplify the management of asynchronous code by allowing for the composition of multiple asynchronous operations.

## Future

Future is an object that represents a value that will eventually be available. It is used to represent a value that will eventually be available, and allows for the composition of multiple asynchronous operations. Futures are used to simplify the management of asynchronous code by allowing for the composition of multiple asynchronous operations. Futures are also used as a way to manage the results of asynchronous operations, allowing for the chaining of multiple operations.
