**1. Selecting the Node:**

The first step is to select the node that you want to remove all child elements from. This can be done using the `document.querySelector()` method. The argument passed to this method is a CSS selector that specifies the node you want to select. 

**2. Removing Child Elements:**

Once the node is selected, you can use the `removeChild()` method to remove all of its child elements. This method takes a single argument, which is the node that you want to remove. You can use a `while` loop to iterate through the node's child elements and remove them one by one. 

**3. Updating the DOM:**

Once all of the child elements have been removed, you will need to update the DOM to reflect the changes. This can be done using the `document.update()` method. This method takes no arguments and will update the DOM to reflect the changes that were made.

**4. Cleaning Up:**

Finally, you will need to clean up any references to the nodes that were removed. This can be done using the `deleteNode()` method. This method takes a single argument, which is the node that you want to delete. This will remove any references to the node and free up memory.
