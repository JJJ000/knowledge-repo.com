1. Using a Logging Library
  - Utilize a logging library like [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) to replace all `console.log` statements with `logger.info`.
  - Set the logging level to `error` or `warn` to prevent any `info` log messages from being outputted.
  - This approach allows for greater flexibility and control over logging, as well as the ability to easily switch back to `info` logging if needed.

2. Using a Preprocessor
  - Use a preprocessor like [UglifyJS](https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS) to remove all `console.log` statements from the code.
  - This approach is less flexible, as all `console.log` statements will be removed, regardless of their logging level.

3. Using a Custom Function
  - Create a custom function to replace `console.log` statements.
  - This function can be used to output log messages to a file or database, or simply to do nothing (i.e., disable all logging).

4. Commenting Out Log Statements
  - Comment out all `console.log` statements in the code.
  - This approach is the easiest and fastest, but also the least maintainable, as commented out code can be difficult to read and debug.
