### Declaration

The plus symbol before a variable in Javascript is used to declare a variable as a number. This is necessary because Javascript is a loosely typed language, meaning that it can interpret a variable as different data types (such as a string, number, boolean, etc.) depending on how it is used.

### Syntax

The plus symbol before a variable is also used as a shorthand syntax to convert a string to a number. This is especially useful when dealing with user input, as it is often in the form of a string. By adding the plus symbol before a string, the string can be converted to a number.

### Type Coercion

The plus symbol before a variable is also used to perform type coercion. This means that it can convert the data type of a variable to a number, even if the variable is not declared as such. This can be useful when dealing with mathematical operations, as it ensures that the variables are being treated as numbers.
