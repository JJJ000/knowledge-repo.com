## String Concatenation
In JavaScript, the `+` operator is used for string concatenation. When the `+` operator is used with two lists, the lists are automatically converted to strings and concatenated together.

## Automatic Type Conversion
In JavaScript, when two objects of different types are combined using the `+` operator, the objects are automatically converted to strings. This is why when two lists are combined using the `+` operator, the result is a string.

When a list is converted to a string, each element of the list is converted to a string and separated by a comma. This is why when two lists are combined using the `+` operator, the result is a string with each element of the lists separated by a comma.
