### Definition

An object can be considered empty if it has no properties or if its properties have no values assigned to them.

### Checking for Empty Objects

In JavaScript, an empty object can be checked by using the `Object.keys()` method. This method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable properties, in the same order as that provided by a `for...in` loop. If the array is empty, the object is empty.

### Examples

```javascript
// Empty object
let emptyObj = {};

// Check if empty
if (Object.keys(emptyObj).length === 0) {
  console.log("Object is empty");
}

// Non-empty object
let nonEmptyObj = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};

// Check if empty
if (Object.keys(nonEmptyObj).length > 0) {
  console.log("Object is not empty");
}
```

### Conclusion

In conclusion, an object can be considered empty if it has no properties or if its properties have no values assigned to them. To check if an object is empty, the `Object.keys()` method can be used to check if the object has any properties.
