#### Introduction
ExecJS is a JavaScript runtime for Ruby and other programming languages. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code from within their applications. It is a popular tool for running JavaScript on the server-side, and is used by many web frameworks such as Rails and Node.js.

#### Problem
The problem arises when the system does not have a JavaScript runtime installed. Without a JavaScript runtime, ExecJS cannot execute JavaScript code. This can lead to errors and can prevent applications from running properly.

#### Solution
The solution is to install a JavaScript runtime. The most popular JavaScript runtimes are Node.js and V8. Node.js is a popular JavaScript runtime that is used by many web frameworks, while V8 is a more lightweight runtime that is used by Google Chrome. 

#### Conclusion
In summary, if the system does not have a JavaScript runtime installed, ExecJS will not be able to execute JavaScript code. To fix this problem, a JavaScript runtime must be installed. Popular JavaScript runtimes include Node.js and V8.
