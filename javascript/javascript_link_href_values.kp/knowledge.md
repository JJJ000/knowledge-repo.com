### "#"

The "#" symbol is used to create a link to the same page. It can be used to create an anchor link, which allows the user to jump to a specific part of the page. It can also be used to create a link that triggers a JavaScript event when clicked.

### "javascript:void(0)"

The "javascript:void(0)" value is used to create a link that does not cause the page to reload when clicked. It is often used when creating links that trigger a JavaScript event, such as a popup window or a form submission. It can also be used to create a link that does nothing when clicked.
