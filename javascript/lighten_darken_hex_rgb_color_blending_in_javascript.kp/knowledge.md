**Using Hex Color Values**

**Lightening a Hex Color**

To lighten a hex color, you can simply increase the value of each of the three color components (red, green, and blue). For example, to lighten the color #0000FF (blue) by 50%, you would increase the red and green components to #8080FF.

**Darkening a Hex Color**

To darken a hex color, you can simply decrease the value of each of the three color components (red, green, and blue). For example, to darken the color #0000FF (blue) by 50%, you would decrease the red and green components to #000080.

**Blending Colors**

To blend two hex colors together, you can average the value of each of the three color components (red, green, and blue). For example, to blend the colors #FF0000 (red) and #00FF00 (green) together, you would average the red and green components to #808080.
