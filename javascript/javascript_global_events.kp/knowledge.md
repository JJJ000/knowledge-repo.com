1. What is a Global Event Mechanism?
A global event mechanism is an event-driven programming model used in web browsers to handle user interactions, such as mouse clicks, key presses, and scrolling. It is based on the DOM (Document Object Model) and is used to create dynamic web pages.

2. How Does it Work?
The global event mechanism is based on a publish-subscribe pattern. When an event occurs, the browser publishes an event object which contains information about the event. This event object is then passed to all the event handlers that are registered for the particular event. The event handlers then process the event object and execute the appropriate code.

3. Benefits of Using a Global Event Mechanism
Using a global event mechanism allows for a more efficient way of handling events. It allows for the separation of concerns, since the event handlers can be written independently of the code that triggers the event. This makes it easier to maintain the code, as well as to add new event handlers. Additionally, the global event mechanism makes it easier to debug code, since the code that triggers the event can be easily identified.

4. Disadvantages of Using a Global Event Mechanism
The main disadvantage of using a global event mechanism is that it can be difficult to debug, since the code that triggers the event is not always easy to identify. Additionally, it can be difficult to keep track of all the event handlers that are registered for a particular event, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Finally, it can be difficult to ensure that all the event handlers are properly executed, which can lead to inconsistencies in the application.
