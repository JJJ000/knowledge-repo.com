#1 Using fs.copyFile()
The fs.copyFile() method is the fastest way to copy a file in Node.js. This method is available as part of the fs (file system) module, and it takes two parameters: the source file path and the destination path.

#2 Example
Below is an example of how to use the fs.copyFile() method:

```
const fs = require('fs');

fs.copyFile('source_file.txt', 'destination_file.txt', (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('File copied successfully!');
});
```

#3 Benefits
Using the fs.copyFile() method has several benefits. It is fast, reliable, and requires minimal code. Additionally, it is non-blocking, meaning that it will not block the main thread while it is running.

#4 Limitations
The fs.copyFile() method does have some limitations. It will only copy the content of a file, not the file's metadata. Additionally, it cannot be used to copy directories.
