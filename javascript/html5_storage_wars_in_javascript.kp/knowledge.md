### HTML5 Local Storage
HTML5 Local Storage is a type of web storage that allows web applications and pages to store data locally within the user's browser. It is persistent, meaning the data stored remains even after the browser window is closed.

### HTML5 Session Storage
HTML5 Session Storage is a type of web storage that allows web applications and pages to store data locally within the user's browser, but only for the duration of the current session. It is not persistent, meaning the data stored is cleared once the browser window is closed.

### Differences
The main difference between HTML5 Local Storage and HTML5 Session Storage is that HTML5 Local Storage is persistent and HTML5 Session Storage is not. HTML5 Local Storage is also more secure than HTML5 Session Storage, as the data stored in HTML5 Local Storage is not accessible to any other websites.

### Uses
HTML5 Local Storage can be used to store data such as user preferences, settings, or information that needs to be remembered between sessions. HTML5 Session Storage can be used to store data that needs to be available for the duration of the current session, such as temporary data or data that needs to be shared between multiple windows.
