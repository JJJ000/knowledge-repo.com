1. Use a Server-Side Solution:
One way to prevent an HTTP request just for a favicon is to use a server-side solution. This can be done by setting up a server-side route that serves the favicon directly from the server. This way, the browser will not have to make an extra HTTP request for the favicon.

2. Use a Client-Side Solution:
Another way to prevent an HTTP request just for a favicon is to use a client-side solution. This can be done by adding the favicon directly to the HTML document. This way, the browser will not have to make an extra HTTP request for the favicon.

3. Use a CDN:
A third way to prevent an HTTP request just for a favicon is to use a content delivery network (CDN). This can be done by hosting the favicon on a CDN and then linking to it from the HTML document. This way, the browser will not have to make an extra HTTP request for the favicon.

4. Use a Preload Directive:
A fourth way to prevent an HTTP request just for a favicon is to use a preload directive. This can be done by adding a preload directive to the HTML document that specifies the favicon. This way, the browser will not have to make an extra HTTP request for the favicon.
