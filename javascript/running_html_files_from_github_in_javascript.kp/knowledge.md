## Yes

GitHub supports the ability to run HTML files directly from its platform. This is accomplished by using GitHub Pages, which is a feature of GitHub that allows users to create websites directly from a repository. With GitHub Pages, users can create a website for their repository, or even a separate website, and embed HTML files into the website. The HTML files can then be accessed directly from the website, allowing them to be viewed and interacted with in the same way as any other website.

## Steps

In order to run HTML files directly from GitHub, the following steps should be taken:

1. Create a GitHub repository that will contain the HTML files.

2. Upload the HTML files to the repository.

3. Enable GitHub Pages for the repository.

4. Embed the HTML files into the GitHub Pages website.

5. Access the HTML files directly from the website.

## Benefits

Using GitHub to run HTML files directly has several benefits. Firstly, it allows users to easily share their HTML files with others, as anyone with the link to the website can view and interact with the HTML files. Secondly, it allows for easier collaboration, as multiple people can work on the same HTML files at the same time. Finally, it allows for easier version control, as users can easily revert to older versions of the HTML files if needed.
