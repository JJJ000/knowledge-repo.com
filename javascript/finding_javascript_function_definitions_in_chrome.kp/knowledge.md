1. Accessing the Developer Tools Console

To access the Developer Tools Console in Chrome, open the Chrome browser, right-click on the page, and select "Inspect". This will open the Developer Tools window at the bottom of the page.

2. Navigating to the JavaScript Function Definition

Once the Developer Tools window is open, click on the "Sources" tab. This will open the Sources panel, which contains the JavaScript code for the page. To access the JavaScript function definition, search for the function name in the Sources panel.

3. Viewing the JavaScript Function Definition

Once the desired function is located, it can be viewed in the Sources panel. The definition of the function will be shown in the panel, along with any other code associated with the function.

4. Debugging the JavaScript Function

Once the function definition is located, it can be debugged by setting breakpoints and stepping through the code. This can be done by right-clicking on the line of code containing the function definition and selecting "Set Breakpoint". This will pause the code at the breakpoint and allow the user to step through the code line-by-line.
