tldr: The best way to tell if a browser/tab is active in Javascript is to use the Page Visibility API.

1. Using Page Visibility API #
The Page Visibility API provides events and properties that can be used to detect the visibility of a web page. This API can be used to determine if the browser or tab is active or not. 

2. Using Focus and Blur Events #
Focus and blur events can be used to detect if the browser or tab is active or not. The focus event is triggered when the browser window or tab gains focus. The blur event is triggered when the browser window or tab loses focus. 

3. Using Visibility Change Event #
The visibilitychange event is triggered when the visibility of the page changes. This event can be used to detect if the browser or tab is active or not. 

4. Using setInterval() Method #
The setInterval() method can be used to detect if the browser or tab is active or not. This method can be used to set a timer that is triggered every few seconds. If the timer is triggered, it can be used to determine if the browser or tab is active or not.
