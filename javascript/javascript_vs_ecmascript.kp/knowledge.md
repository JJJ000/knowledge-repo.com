# Definition

JavaScript is a scripting language that was originally developed by Netscape in 1995. It is a dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based language with first-class functions.

ECMAScript is a scripting language specification created to standardize JavaScript. It was created by the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and first published in 1997.

# Differences

1. JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript specification.
2. JavaScript is a programming language, while ECMAScript is a scripting language specification.
3. JavaScript is a full-fledged programming language, while ECMAScript is a scripting language specification that is used to create programming languages like JavaScript.
4. JavaScript is more widely used than ECMAScript, as it has been around longer and is more widely supported.
