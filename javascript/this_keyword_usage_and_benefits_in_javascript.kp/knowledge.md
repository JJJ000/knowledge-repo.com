tldr: The `this` keyword refers to the object that the code is currently being executed within, and should usually be used within the context of an object to refer to its properties.

# What is "this"

In JavaScript, "this" is a keyword that refers to the object it belongs to. It is an important concept in object-oriented programming and is used to access the properties of an object and to call the methods of an object.

# How "this" Works

The value of "this" is determined by how a function is called. If the function is called as a method of an object, "this" is set to the object the method is called on. If the function is called as a free function, "this" is set to the global object. If the function is called using the "new" operator, "this" is set to the newly created object.

# When to Use "this"

The "this" keyword should be used when you want to access the properties or methods of the object it belongs to. It is particularly useful when writing methods for an object, as it allows you to access the properties and methods of the object without having to explicitly pass the object as an argument.

# Caveats

It is important to note that the value of "this" can change depending on how the function is called. Care should be taken to ensure that the value of "this" is the expected value when writing code. Additionally, it is important to note that the value of "this" is not affected by lexical scope.
