[TOC]

1. **General Naming Rules**
  - File names should be lowercase and use hyphens to separate words.
  - File names should not include special characters or spaces.
  - File names should be descriptive and concise.

2. **Extension**
  - JavaScript files should use the `.js` extension.

3. **Versioning**
  - When creating multiple versions of a file, use the version number in the file name. For example, `myfile-v1.js` and `myfile-v2.js`.

4. **Organization**
  - To keep files organized, use a directory structure to group related files. For example, `/js/` for all JavaScript files and `/css/` for all CSS files.
