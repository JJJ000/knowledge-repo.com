**Section 1: HTML Encoding**

HTML encoding is a way of representing characters, such as spaces, punctuation, and special characters, in a way that is readable by web browsers. It is used to prevent malicious code from being executed when a user visits a web page. HTML encoding is accomplished by replacing certain characters with their corresponding HTML entities. 

**Section 2: Input Field**

An input field is an area on a web page that allows a user to enter data. It can be used to collect information from a user, such as a name, email address, or phone number. The data entered into an input field is typically sent to a server for processing.

**Section 3: HTML Encoding Lost**

When a user enters data into an input field, the HTML encoding is lost. This is because the data is sent to the server as plain text, without any HTML encoding. This means that any special characters or HTML entities will not be interpreted correctly by the server.

**Section 4: Javascript**

In order to prevent HTML encoding from being lost when a user enters data into an input field, JavaScript can be used. JavaScript can be used to detect and encode any special characters or HTML entities before the data is submitted to the server. This ensures that the data is interpreted correctly by the server and displayed correctly on the web page.
