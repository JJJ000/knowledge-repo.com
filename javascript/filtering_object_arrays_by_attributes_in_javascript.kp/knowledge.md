## Section 1: Accessing Object Properties

The first step to filtering an object array based on attributes is to access the object properties. This can be done by using the `Object.keys()` method to get an array of the object's keys, and then using the `Object.values()` method to get the values associated with each key.

## Section 2: Iterating Over the Object Array

Once the object properties have been accessed, the next step is to iterate over the object array. This can be done using a `for` loop, which will allow the code to loop through each object in the array and access its properties.

## Section 3: Comparing Object Properties

Once the object properties have been accessed and the object array has been iterated over, the next step is to compare the object properties. This can be done by using an `if` statement to compare the value of the desired property to the value of the object's property. If the values match, the object can be added to a new filtered array.

## Section 4: Creating the Filtered Array

The last step to filtering an object array based on attributes is to create the filtered array. This can be done by using a `forEach()` loop to iterate over the object array and check each object's properties. If the object's properties match the desired criteria, it can be added to the new array.
