tldr: The best way to store a key=>value array in JavaScript is to use an object.

[TOC]

1. **Using an Object**
An object is the most common way to store key-value pairs in JavaScript. Objects use key-value pairs to store data, and the key can be used to access the associated value.

```javascript
let myObject = {
    key1: "value1",
    key2: "value2",
    key3: "value3"
};
```

2. **Using an Array**
Arrays are a type of data structure in JavaScript that can store multiple values in a single variable. Each value in an array is associated with an index, and can be accessed using the index.

```javascript
let myArray = ["value1", "value2", "value3"];

// Accessing the values
let value1 = myArray[0];
let value2 = myArray[1];
let value3 = myArray[2];
```

3. **Using a Map**
Maps are a type of data structure in JavaScript that store key-value pairs. The keys in a Map can be any type, including objects, and the values can be any type as well.

```javascript
let myMap = new Map();

// Adding key-value pairs
myMap.set("key1", "value1");
myMap.set("key2", "value2");
myMap.set("key3", "value3");

// Accessing the values
let value1 = myMap.get("key1");
let value2 = myMap.get("key2");
let value3 = myMap.get("key3");
```

4. **Using a WeakMap**
WeakMaps are similar to Maps, but they are optimized for use with objects as keys. WeakMaps are not iterable, so they cannot be looped over, but they can be used to store key-value pairs where the key is an object.

```javascript
let myWeakMap = new WeakMap();

// Adding key-value pairs
let obj1 = {};
let obj2 = {};
let obj3 = {};

myWeakMap.set(obj1, "value1");
myWeakMap.set(obj2, "value2");
myWeakMap.set(obj3, "value3");

// Accessing the values
let value1 = myWeakMap.get(obj1);
let value2 = myWeakMap.get(obj2);
let value3 = myWeakMap.get(obj3);
```
