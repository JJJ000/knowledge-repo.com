tldr: Client-side programming is code that runs in the browser and is responsible for the user interface, while server-side programming is code that runs on the server and is responsible for back-end tasks.

#### Client-Side Programming
Client-side programming is code that is executed in the user’s browser. This code is typically written in JavaScript and allows for interactive elements, such as forms, animations, and more. This code is downloaded from the server and then interpreted by the browser.

#### Server-Side Programming
Server-side programming is code that is executed on the server. This code is typically written in a language such as PHP, Java, or Python. Server-side code is responsible for processing requests from the user, such as retrieving data from a database or generating a response. The server then sends the response back to the user’s browser.
