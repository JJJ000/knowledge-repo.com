[TOC]

### Package Management
Bower and npm are both package managers for JavaScript. Bower is a package manager for the web, while npm is a package manager for Node.js.

### Package Sources
Bower is focused on the front-end and is used to manage web libraries such as jQuery, Angular, and Bootstrap. npm is focused on the server-side and is used to manage Node.js modules.

### Installation and Usage
Bower is installed via npm and is used to install, update, and uninstall packages. npm is installed via Node.js and is used to install, update, and uninstall Node.js modules.

### Package Versioning
Bower uses Semantic Versioning, which means that when a package is updated, the version number is incremented based on the changes made. npm uses SemVer as well, but it also allows for non-semantic versioning, which means that the version number can be changed at any time.
