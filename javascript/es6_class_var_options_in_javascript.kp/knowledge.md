**Object Literals**
Object literals are a simple way to create an object in JavaScript. They are composed of comma-separated key-value pairs, surrounded by curly braces. 

**Object Constructors**
Object constructors are used to create objects from a template. The constructor is a function that is used to create an object. 

**Factory Functions**
Factory functions are functions that return an object. They are a popular way to create objects in JavaScript. They are often used when the object has a lot of properties or methods that need to be initialized. 

**Prototypal Inheritance**
Prototypal inheritance is a way to create objects that inherit properties and methods from other objects. It uses the prototype property of an object to create a new object that inherits the properties and methods of the original object.
