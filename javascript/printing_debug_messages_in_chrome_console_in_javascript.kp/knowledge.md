[TOC]

1. Open the Console
--------------------------------
The first step to printing debug messages in the Google Chrome JavaScript Console is to open the console. This can be done by pressing the `F12` key, or by right-clicking on the page and selecting `Inspect`.

2. Use the `console.log()` Method
--------------------------------
Once the console is open, debug messages can be printed by using the `console.log()` method. This method takes a string argument, which is the message that will be printed.

3. Print the Message
--------------------
To print the message, simply call the `console.log()` method with the desired message as an argument. For example, `console.log('This is a debug message')` will print the message "This is a debug message" to the console.

4. View the Output
------------------
Once the `console.log()` method is called, the message will be printed to the console. The output can be viewed in the console window.
