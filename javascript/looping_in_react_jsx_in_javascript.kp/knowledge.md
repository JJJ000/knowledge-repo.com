**Section 1: What is React JSX?**

React JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript code. It is used to create React components, which are reusable pieces of code that can be used to create user interfaces.

**Section 2: What is a Loop?**

A loop is a type of programming construct that allows a set of instructions to be repeated multiple times. Loops are often used to iterate over a set of data, such as an array or a list.

**Section 3: How to Use a Loop in React JSX**

In React JSX, loops can be used to iterate over a set of data and render each item in the set. This is done using the JavaScript map() method, which takes a function as an argument and calls that function for each item in the set. The function should return a React element, which will be rendered in the component.

**Section 4: Example**

For example, if we have an array of numbers called `numbers`, we can use the `map()` method to render each number in the array:

```jsx
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const NumbersList = () => (
  <ul>
    {numbers.map(number => (
      <li>{number}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);
```

The `map()` method will call the function for each item in the `numbers` array, and the result of the function will be rendered in the component. In this example, the function will return a `<li>` element containing the number, which will be rendered in the component.
