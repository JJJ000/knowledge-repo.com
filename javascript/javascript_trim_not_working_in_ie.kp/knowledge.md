##### Explanation
The `String.prototype.trim()` method in JavaScript is used to remove whitespace from the beginning and end of a string. This method is widely supported across all modern browsers, except for Internet Explorer (IE).

##### Reason for Lack of Support in IE
The `String.prototype.trim()` method was first introduced in ECMAScript 5 (ES5) in 2009. However, Internet Explorer 8 (IE8) was released in 2009, and it did not support ES5. Therefore, IE8 and earlier versions of Internet Explorer do not have support for the `String.prototype.trim()` method.

##### Workaround
A workaround for this issue is to use a regular expression to remove the whitespace from the beginning and end of a string. The following code snippet shows how this can be done:

```javascript
// Removes whitespace from beginning and end of string
let str = str.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g, '');
```

##### Conclusion
The `String.prototype.trim()` method is not supported in Internet Explorer due to the fact that IE8 and earlier versions of IE do not support ECMAScript 5. However, a workaround for this issue is to use a regular expression to remove the whitespace from the beginning and end of a string.
