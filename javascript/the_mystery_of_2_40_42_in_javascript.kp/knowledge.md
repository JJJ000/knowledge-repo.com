## Explanation of Unicode 
In Javascript, Unicode is a character encoding standard that assigns a unique number to each character. The Unicode character for the plus sign is U+002B and has the hexadecimal code of  . This Unicode character is used to represent the mathematical symbol for addition. 

## JavaScript Syntax 
In JavaScript, the syntax for addition is to use the plus sign (+). When a Unicode character is used instead of the plus sign, the syntax is still the same and the Unicode character is treated as the plus sign. 

## Evaluation of Expression 
When the expression 2+ 40 is evaluated, JavaScript interprets the Unicode character for the plus sign as the mathematical symbol for addition. This expression is evaluated as 2 + 40, which is equal to 42. 

## Summary 
In summary, 2+ 40 is equal to 42 in JavaScript because Unicode characters are treated as the same as the plus sign in the JavaScript syntax. The expression is evaluated as 2 + 40, which is equal to 42.
