### Using the ternary operator
The ternary operator can be used to conditionally add attributes to React components. The syntax for this is as follows: 

```
<MyComponent
  attributeName={condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse}
/>
```

In this example, if the condition evaluates to true, the attributeName will be set to valueIfTrue. If the condition evaluates to false, the attributeName will be set to valueIfFalse.

### Using the && operator
The && operator can also be used to conditionally add attributes to React components. The syntax for this is as follows:

```
<MyComponent
  {condition && <Attribute attributeName={value} />}
/>
```

In this example, if the condition evaluates to true, the attributeName will be set to value. If the condition evaluates to false, the attributeName will not be set.

### Using the ternary operator and the && operator together
The ternary operator and the && operator can be used together to conditionally add attributes to React components. The syntax for this is as follows:

```
<MyComponent
  {condition ? 
    <Attribute attributeName={valueIfTrue} />
    :
    <Attribute attributeName={valueIfFalse} />
  }
/>
```

In this example, if the condition evaluates to true, the attributeName will be set to valueIfTrue. If the condition evaluates to false, the attributeName will be set to valueIfFalse.
