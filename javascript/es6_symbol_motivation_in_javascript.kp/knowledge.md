1. Improved Readability:
Symbols in ES6 provide a way to create unique, immutable primitives that can be used as identifiers for object properties. This helps to improve the readability of code by making it easier to distinguish between different properties.

2. Improved Performance:
Symbols in ES6 are stored as primitives and thus do not require the same amount of memory as strings or other objects. This can result in improved performance when dealing with large datasets.

3. Improved Security:
Symbols in ES6 are immutable and cannot be changed or tampered with. This makes it harder for malicious actors to access or modify sensitive data, improving the overall security of applications.

4. Improved Code Reuse:
Symbols in ES6 can be used to create unique identifiers for object properties. This makes it easier for developers to create modules or components that can be reused across multiple projects, making development more efficient.
