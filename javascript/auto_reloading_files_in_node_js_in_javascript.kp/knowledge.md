## Using Nodemon

Nodemon is a tool that can help with auto-reloading files in Node.js. It will watch the files in the directory in which nodemon was started, and if any files change, nodemon will automatically restart your node application.

To install nodemon, use the command:

```
npm install -g nodemon
```

Then, to use nodemon, simply run the command:

```
nodemon <your_main_node_file.js>
```

## Using Browserify

Browserify is a tool that can help with auto-reloading files in Node.js. It will watch the files in the directory in which it was started, and if any files change, it will automatically bundle the changed files and reload them in the browser.

To install browserify, use the command:

```
npm install -g browserify
```

Then, to use browserify, simply run the command:

```
browserify <your_main_node_file.js>
```

## Using Gulp

Gulp is a task runner that can help with auto-reloading files in Node.js. It can be used to watch the files in the directory in which it was started, and if any files change, it will automatically reload the changed files.

To install gulp, use the command:

```
npm install -g gulp
```

Then, to use gulp, simply create a gulpfile.js in the root of your project, and add the following code to it:

```
var gulp = require('gulp');

gulp.task('default', function() {
  gulp.watch(['<your_main_node_file.js>'], ['reload']);
});

gulp.task('reload', function() {
  require('<your_main_node_file.js>');
});
```

Finally, to start gulp, simply run the command:

```
gulp
```
