# Syntax

The "=>" (arrow function) syntax is used in JavaScript to define a function expression. It is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions compared to the traditional function keyword syntax.

# Usage

The arrow function syntax can be used in place of a regular function expression when the function body consists of a single statement that returns a value. This is often referred to as an "implicit return" because the return keyword is not used.

# Benefits

The arrow function syntax is beneficial because it is shorter and more concise than the traditional function keyword syntax. It also eliminates the need for the return keyword in single-statement functions, allowing for cleaner and more concise code.

# Limitations

The arrow function syntax has some limitations. It cannot be used when the function body consists of multiple statements or when a function needs to be named. Additionally, the arrow function syntax cannot be used in the global scope.
