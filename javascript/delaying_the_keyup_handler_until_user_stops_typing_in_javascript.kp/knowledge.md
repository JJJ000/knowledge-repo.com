**Section 1: Set a Timer**

The most common way to delay the .keyup() handler until the user stops typing is to set a timer. This can be done using the setTimeout() function, which takes a function as its first argument and a delay in milliseconds as its second argument.

**Section 2: Clear the Timer**

Once the timer is set, it must be cleared when the user stops typing. This can be done using the clearTimeout() function, which takes the timer ID as its argument.

**Section 3: Create a Handler Function**

The handler function should be written to perform the desired action once the user stops typing. This function should be passed as the first argument to the setTimeout() function.

**Section 4: Trigger the Handler**

Once the timer is set and the handler function is written, the handler should be triggered when the user stops typing. This can be done by using the .keyup() event listener, which will execute the handler function when the user releases a key.
