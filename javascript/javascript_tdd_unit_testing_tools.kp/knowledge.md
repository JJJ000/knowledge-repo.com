###1. Jasmine
Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code. It does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.

###2. Mocha
Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.

###3. QUnit
QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use JavaScript unit testing framework. It's used by the jQuery, jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile projects and is capable of testing any generic JavaScript code, including itself!

###4. Jest
Jest is a JavaScript testing framework created by Facebook. It's used by Facebook to test all JavaScript code including React applications. Jest is fast and has an integrated coverage report and assertion library. It's easy to set up and you can run tests in parallel.
