Yes, you can find events bound on an element with jQuery in Javascript. 

## Using `.on()`

The `.on()` method can be used to find events bound on an element. It allows you to attach event handlers for all selected elements, as well as to find events that have been previously bound to the elements. 

## Using `.off()`

The `.off()` method can also be used to find events bound on an element. It allows you to remove event handlers from all selected elements, as well as to find events that have been previously bound to the elements. 

## Using `.trigger()`

The `.trigger()` method can be used to find events bound on an element. It allows you to trigger event handlers for all selected elements, as well as to find events that have been previously bound to the elements. 

## Using `.data()`

The `.data()` method can also be used to find events bound on an element. It allows you to retrieve data associated with the selected elements, as well as to find events that have been previously bound to the elements.
