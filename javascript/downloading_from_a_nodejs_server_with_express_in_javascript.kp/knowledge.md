[TOC]

# Section 1: Set Up Express Server

To download a file from a NodeJS server using Express, you must first set up an Express server. This can be done by installing the Express package and creating an Express application.

# Section 2: Create a Route

Once the Express server is set up, you must create a route that will handle the file download. The route should include a function that will read the file from the server and send it back to the client.

# Section 3: Send the File

The next step is to send the file to the client. This can be done by using the `res.download()` method in the Express application. This method takes the file path as an argument and sends the file to the client.

# Section 4: Test the Download

Once the file is sent to the client, you can test the download by accessing the route from a web browser. If everything is working correctly, the file should be downloaded to the client's computer.
