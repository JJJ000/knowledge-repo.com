[TOC]

# Invalid Characters
◎ܫ◎ and ☺ contain invalid characters for use in variable names in JavaScript. JavaScript variable names must start with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($). They can contain any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. 

# Unicode Characters
The characters ◎ܫ◎ and ☺ are Unicode characters, and Unicode characters are not allowed in JavaScript variable names. Unicode characters are a set of characters that are used to represent almost all of the world's written languages.

# Reserved Keywords
In addition, JavaScript has a list of reserved keywords that cannot be used as variable names. These keywords are used to identify certain types of data and operations, and they are reserved for the JavaScript interpreter. 

# Variable Naming Conventions
Finally, there are a few conventions that should be followed when naming variables in JavaScript. It is best practice to use descriptive names that are easy to read and understand. Variable names should also be short and concise.
