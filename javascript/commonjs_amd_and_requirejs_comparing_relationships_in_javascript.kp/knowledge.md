[TOC]

## CommonJS
CommonJS is a JavaScript standard for specifying the format of modules. It is a way to define how modules should be structured, how they should be loaded, and how they should be used. It is an independent, open source project that is designed to work in any environment.

## AMD
AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) is a JavaScript API for defining modules that can be loaded asynchronously. It is a way to define modules that can be loaded in the background and then used when they are needed.

## RequireJS
RequireJS is a JavaScript library that implements the AMD API. It is a way to define modules that can be loaded in the background and then used when they are needed. It is a popular library that is used in many web applications.

## Relationship
CommonJS and AMD are two different ways to define modules in JavaScript. RequireJS is a library that implements the AMD API, so it is a way to use the AMD API in your web application.
