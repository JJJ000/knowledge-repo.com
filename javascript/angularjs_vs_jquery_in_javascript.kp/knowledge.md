**Contents**

[TOC]

**Functionality**

AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web applications. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. AngularJS is a full-featured JavaScript framework, and it is more suitable for developing single-page applications.

jQuery is a fast and concise JavaScript library. It simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. jQuery is a library, not a framework. It is more suitable for developing user interfaces and manipulating the DOM.

**Data Binding**

AngularJS provides two-way data binding, which means that the model and view are always in sync. Changes to the model are immediately reflected in the view, and changes to the view are immediately reflected in the model.

jQuery does not provide two-way data binding. It requires manual intervention to keep the model and view in sync.

**Dependency Injection**

AngularJS has a built-in dependency injection system that allows you to easily inject services into your controllers and other components.

jQuery does not have a built-in dependency injection system. You have to manually inject services into your components.

**Testing**

AngularJS has built-in support for unit testing and end-to-end testing.

jQuery does not have built-in support for unit testing and end-to-end testing.
