# Solution

## Overview
The error "$ is not defined" is a common problem encountered when working with JavaScript and jQuery. It occurs when the jQuery library is not properly loaded or referenced in the HTML document.

## Causes
The "$ is not defined" error can be caused by several different issues, including:

1. The jQuery library is not loaded in the HTML document.
2. The jQuery library is loaded, but not before the script that is attempting to use it.
3. The jQuery library is referenced incorrectly.

## Solutions

1. Ensure that the jQuery library is properly loaded in the HTML document.
2. Ensure that the jQuery library is loaded before any scripts that are attempting to use it.
3. Ensure that the jQuery library is referenced correctly.
