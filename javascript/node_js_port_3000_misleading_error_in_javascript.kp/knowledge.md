## Check For Running Processes

The first step to take when troubleshooting port conflicts is to check for any running processes that may be using the port. To do this, you can use the `netstat` command on Linux or Mac, or `netstat -a` on Windows. This will list all the ports that are currently in use and the processes that are using them.

## Kill Unnecessary Processes

If you find any processes that are using port 3000, you can kill them using the `kill` command. For example, `kill -9 <process_id>` will kill the process with the given ID.

## Check Firewall Settings

If there are no processes using port 3000, then it is possible that your firewall is blocking access to that port. You can check your firewall settings to make sure that port 3000 is not blocked.

## Change the Node.js Port

If all else fails, you can always change the port that Node.js is using. This can be done by editing the `port` variable in the `server.js` file.
