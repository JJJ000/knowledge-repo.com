### Null
Null is a special value in JavaScript that indicates that a variable has no value. It is the only value of its type and is written as null in JavaScript.

### Undefined
Undefined is a special value in JavaScript that indicates that a variable has been declared, but has not been assigned a value. It is the only value of its type and is written as undefined in JavaScript.

### Difference
The main difference between null and undefined is that null is an assignment value and undefined is a type itself. Null is an intentional assignment to a variable, while undefined is a value that is given to a variable when it has not been assigned a value.
