**Section 1: Iterate Through Array**

The most efficient way to groupby on an array of objects in Javascript is to iterate through the array and create a new object for each unique key. This can be done using a for loop, forEach loop, or a while loop.

**Section 2: Use Object.entries()**

Another efficient way to groupby on an array of objects is to use the Object.entries() method. This method will return an array of key-value pairs for each object in the array. This array can then be used to create a new object with the unique keys.

**Section 3: Use Array.prototype.reduce()**

The Array.prototype.reduce() method is also an efficient way to groupby on an array of objects. This method will iterate through the array and create a new object with the unique keys. The reduce() method also allows for more flexibility when creating the new object.

**Section 4: Use Lodash's GroupBy() Method**

The Lodash library also provides a groupBy() method that can be used to groupby on an array of objects. This method is very efficient and can be used to quickly create a new object with the unique keys.
