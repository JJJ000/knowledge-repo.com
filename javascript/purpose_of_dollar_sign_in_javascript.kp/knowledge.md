# Usage
The dollar sign ($) is used in JavaScript as a shorthand for the word "jQuery". It is a library of pre-written JavaScript code that makes it easier to use JavaScript on your website.

# Syntax
The dollar sign is used as a shortcut when writing jQuery code. For example, you can use the following syntax to select an element by its ID:

`$('#myElement')`

# Benefits
Using the dollar sign can make your code more concise and easier to read. It also allows developers to quickly identify code that is using jQuery, which can be helpful when debugging.

# Alternatives
If you are not using jQuery, you can use the standard JavaScript syntax for selecting elements, such as `document.getElementById('myElement')`.
