# Slice Method
The slice() method is the fastest way to duplicate an array in JavaScript. It creates a shallow copy of an array, meaning that the original array is not modified. The syntax is: array.slice(start, end). The slice() method takes two parameters, start and end, both of which are optional. The start parameter is the index at which to begin the slice, and the end parameter is the index at which to end the slice.

# For Loop
A 'for' loop can also be used to duplicate an array in JavaScript. The syntax is: for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) { // code here } The loop iterates over each element in the array and copies it to a new array. This method is slower than the slice() method, but it is more versatile, as it allows for more complex operations to be performed on the array elements.

# Pros and Cons
The slice() method is faster than the 'for' loop, but it is limited in its functionality. The 'for' loop is slower, but it allows for more complex operations to be performed on the array elements. The choice of which method to use depends on the complexity of the operations that need to be performed on the array.
