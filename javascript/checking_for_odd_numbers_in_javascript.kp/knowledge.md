tldr: Use the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the remainder of a division by 2 is equal to 1 to determine if a number is odd.

#Section 1: Using the Modulus Operator

The modulus operator (%) returns the remainder after a division operation. When a number is divided by 2, an even number will have a remainder of 0, while an odd number will have a remainder of 1.

Therefore, to determine if a number is odd, we can use the modulus operator to check the remainder after the number is divided by 2. If the remainder is equal to 1, then the number is odd.

#Section 2: Using the Bitwise Operator

The bitwise operator ( & ) can also be used to determine if a number is odd. The bitwise operator compares two numbers bit-by-bit and returns a new number with the bits that are set in both numbers.

When a number is divided by 2, the last bit of the number will be set to 1 for odd numbers and 0 for even numbers. Therefore, if we use the bitwise operator to compare the number with the number 1, the result will be 1 for odd numbers and 0 for even numbers.

#Section 3: Using the Math Object

The Math object in JavaScript has a built-in function called Math.isOdd() that can be used to determine if a number is odd. This function takes a single parameter (the number to be tested) and returns a boolean value of true if the number is odd and false if the number is even.

#Section 4: Using an If Statement

We can also use an if statement to determine if a number is odd. The statement will compare the number with the number 1 and return true if the number is odd and false if the number is even.

if (num % 2 == 1) {
  return true;
} else {
  return false;
}
