[TOC]

1. **Preparing the String:**

Before attempting to URL encode a string, it is important to ensure that the string is properly formatted. This includes removing any whitespace, special characters, and other non-alphanumeric characters. Additionally, the string should be converted to lowercase.

2. **Using the `encodeURIComponent` Function:**

Once the string is properly formatted, the `encodeURIComponent` function can be used to URL encode the string. This function is part of the JavaScript built-in `encodeURI` function, and it takes a single string argument.

3. **Example Usage:**

Below is an example of how to use the `encodeURIComponent` function to URL encode a string:

```javascript
let encodedString = encodeURIComponent('This is a string to encode!');
console.log(encodedString); // Outputs: 'This%20is%20a%20string%20to%20encode%21'
```

4. **Note:**

It is important to note that the `encodeURIComponent` function is not suitable for encoding entire URLs. For this purpose, the `encodeURI` function should be used instead.
