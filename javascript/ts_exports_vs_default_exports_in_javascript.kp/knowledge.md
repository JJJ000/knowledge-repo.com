# Export

In both Javascript and Typescript, the `export` statement is used to export functions, objects, or primitive values from the module so they can be used by other programs with the `import` statement.

# Default Export

In Javascript, the `export default` statement is used to export a single value or function from a module. This is the only way to export a single value from a module in Javascript.

In Typescript, the `export default` statement is used to export a single value or function from a module. However, Typescript also supports the `export` statement, which can be used to export multiple values or functions from a module.
