### What is Content Security Policy (CSP)?
Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. It allows web developers to define a set of rules that restrict the resources which a browser can load for a given page.

### How does CSP Work in Javascript?
CSP works in Javascript by allowing developers to set a policy that will be enforced by the browser. The policy specifies which domains the browser should allow for loading resources such as images, scripts, and stylesheets. The policy also defines which types of requests are allowed, such as POST and GET requests.

### Benefits of CSP
CSP helps to prevent malicious code from being injected into a web page, which can help to protect user data and prevent data breaches. It also helps to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, which can be used to steal user data or hijack user sessions. Additionally, CSP can help to improve website performance by only allowing trusted resources to be loaded.

### Limitations of CSP
CSP can be difficult to configure correctly, and mistakes can lead to unexpected behavior or broken pages. Additionally, CSP can be bypassed by attackers who are able to find a way to inject malicious code into a page. Finally, some browsers may not support all of the features of CSP, which can limit its effectiveness.
