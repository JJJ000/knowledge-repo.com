# Syntax

The syntax for printing a message to the error console in Javascript is `console.error(message)`.

# Example

For example, to print the message "An error occurred" to the error console, you would use the following code:

```
console.error("An error occurred");
```

# Output

The output in the error console would be:

```
An error occurred
```

# Notes

It is important to note that the `console.error()` method only prints messages to the error console, and not to the standard output console.
