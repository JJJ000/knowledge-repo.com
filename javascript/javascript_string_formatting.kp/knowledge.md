## Using Template Literals
Template literals are a new way to create strings in JavaScript. They allow for string interpolation, meaning that you can insert variables into a string without having to use string concatenation. Template literals can be used as an equivalent to printf/String.Format.

## Syntax
The syntax for template literals is as follows:

`${variable}`

Where `variable` is the variable you want to insert into the string.

## Example
For example, if you wanted to create a string that said "Hello, my name is Bob", you could use the following code:

```
let name = "Bob";
let str = `Hello, my name is ${name}`;
```

The resulting string would be "Hello, my name is Bob".

## Advantages
The main advantage of using template literals is that it is much easier to read and understand than string concatenation. It also allows for more flexibility when inserting variables into strings.
