####Immediate

Immediate is a function that is part of the Node.js API and is used to execute a function as soon as possible. It is part of the process object and is used to schedule a callback function to be executed immediately after the current event loop cycle.

####NextTick

NextTick is a function that is part of the Node.js API and is used to execute a function after the current event loop cycle. It is part of the process object and is used to schedule a callback function to be executed after the current event loop cycle. It is usually used when you need to perform an action after the current event loop has finished.

####Difference

The main difference between setImmediate and nextTick is that setImmediate will be executed after the current event loop cycle, while nextTick will be executed immediately after the current event loop cycle. This means that setImmediate will be executed after any I/O operations, while nextTick will be executed before any I/O operations.
