## Accessing the Package

The first step to updating a specific package in Javascript is to access it. This can be done by navigating to the package's directory in the file system.

## Updating the Package

Once the package is accessed, the next step is to update it. This can be done by running the command `npm update <package-name>` in the terminal. This command will update the package to the latest version.

## Verifying the Update
