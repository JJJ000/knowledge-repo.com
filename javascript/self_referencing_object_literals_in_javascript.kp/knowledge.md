tldr: Self-references in object literals / initializers in Javascript can be done by assigning the object to a variable and then referencing that variable within the object.

**Section 1: What is an Object Literal / Initializer?**

An object literal / initializer is an expression which creates a JavaScript object. It is written as a set of comma-separated name/value pairs enclosed in curly braces. Each name is followed by a colon and the corresponding value. The names and values can be any valid JavaScript expressions, including functions, variables, literals, and object references.

**Section 2: How to Use Self-References in Object Literals / Initializers**

Self-references in object literals / initializers allow a property to refer to itself. This can be done by using the "this" keyword. For example, the following object literal / initializer has a property "name" which refers to itself:

```js
let person = {
  name: this.name
};
```

This is useful when you want to refer to the same property multiple times in an object literal / initializer.

**Section 3: Benefits of Self-References in Object Literals / Initializers**

Using self-references in object literals / initializers can help to reduce the amount of code needed to create an object. It also makes the code more readable and easier to maintain.

**Section 4: Limitations of Self-References in Object Literals / Initializers**

Self-references in object literals / initializers can be difficult to debug and can lead to unexpected results if used incorrectly. Additionally, self-references can only be used within the same object literal / initializer and cannot be used to refer to properties in other objects.
