### Step 1: Create the Menu

The first step is to create the menu that will appear when a user right-clicks on the webpage. This can be done using HTML and CSS. For example, you could create a `<div>` element with a unique `id` and then style it using CSS.

### Step 2: Add the Event Listener

The next step is to add an event listener to the page that will detect when a user right-clicks on the page. This can be done using the `addEventListener` method. This method takes two parameters, the type of event to listen for and the function to call when the event is detected. In this case, the event type will be `contextmenu` and the function will be used to show the menu.

### Step 3: Show the Menu

The third step is to write the function that will show the menu when the right-click event is detected. This can be done using the `show()` method of the `Element` object. This method takes two parameters, the `id` of the menu element and a boolean value that indicates whether the menu should be visible or not.

### Step 4: Hide the Menu

The fourth and final step is to write a function that will hide the menu when the user clicks elsewhere on the page. This can be done using the `hide()` method of the `Element` object. This method takes the same parameters as the `show()` method.
