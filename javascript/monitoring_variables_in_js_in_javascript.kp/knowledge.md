1. Using `Object.observe()` 
Object.observe() is a JavaScript API that allows you to observe changes to objects. It can be used to detect changes to an object's properties, and to execute a callback function when a change occurs.

2. Using `Proxy()` 
Proxy() is a JavaScript API that allows you to intercept and modify operations performed on an object. It can be used to detect changes to an object's properties, and to execute a callback function when a change occurs.

3. Using `setInterval()` 
setInterval() is a JavaScript API that allows you to execute a callback function at a specified interval. It can be used to detect changes to an object's properties, and to execute a callback function when a change occurs.

4. Using `MutationObserver()` 
MutationObserver() is a JavaScript API that allows you to observe changes to the DOM. It can be used to detect changes to an object's properties, and to execute a callback function when a change occurs.
