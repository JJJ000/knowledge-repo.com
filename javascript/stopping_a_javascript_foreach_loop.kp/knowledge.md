1. Using `break`
   The `break` keyword can be used to stop the execution of a `forEach` loop. `break` will immediately exit the loop, and will not continue to execute the remaining statements.

2. Using `return`
   The `return` keyword can be used to exit from a `forEach` loop. `return` will immediately exit the loop and return a value.

3. Using `throw`
   The `throw` keyword can be used to stop the execution of a `forEach` loop. `throw` will immediately exit the loop and throw an error.

4. Using `continue`
   The `continue` keyword can be used to skip a single iteration of a `forEach` loop. `continue` will immediately exit the current iteration and continue to the next iteration.
