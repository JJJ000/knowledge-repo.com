### 1. Get Element

First, you will need to get access to the select box element. You can do this by using the `document.getElementById()` method. This method takes a single argument, which is the `id` of the element you want to access. 

### 2. Set Value

Once you have access to the element, you can use the `value` property to set the value. The `value` property takes a single argument, which is the value you want to set the select box to. 

### 3. Add Event Listeners

If you want to set the value of the select box when a certain event occurs, you can add an event listener. You can use the `addEventListener()` method to add an event listener. This method takes two arguments, the first is the event you want to listen for and the second is the function that will be called when the event occurs. 

### 4. Call Function

Once you have added the event listener, you will need to call the function that was passed as the second argument to the `addEventListener()` method. This function will contain the code to set the value of the select box.
