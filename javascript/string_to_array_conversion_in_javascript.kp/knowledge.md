**Contents**

[TOC]

**Section 1: Split the String**

The first step to converting a string with commas to an array is to split the string into an array of strings. This can be done using the `String.prototype.split()` method.

**Section 2: Pass in the Separator**

The `split()` method takes a separator as an argument. In this case, the separator is a comma. The `split()` method will then create an array with the strings separated by the comma. 

**Section 3: Assign the Array**

The `split()` method returns an array of strings, which can then be assigned to a variable. 

**Section 4: Use the Array**

The array of strings can now be used as needed. For example, the array can be iterated over, or individual strings can be accessed.
