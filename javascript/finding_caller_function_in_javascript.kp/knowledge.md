# Using the Call Stack

The call stack is a data structure that stores information about the active functions in a program. In JavaScript, the call stack can be used to find out the caller function of a given function.

# Using the Error Object

The Error object in JavaScript provides a stack property which contains a trace of the call stack at the time the Error was thrown. This trace can be used to find out the caller function of a given function.

# Using the Arguments Object

The arguments object of a function contains a callee property which is a reference to the function itself. By using the callee property, it is possible to find out the caller function of a given function.

# Using the Function.caller Property

The Function.caller property is a reference to the function that invoked the currently executing function. By accessing this property, it is possible to find out the caller function of a given function.
