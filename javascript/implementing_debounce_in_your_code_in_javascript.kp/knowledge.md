### 1. What is Debounce?
Debounce is a programming technique which limits the rate at which a function can fire. It is used to improve performance by preventing a function from being called more than once in a given time period.

### 2. How it Works
Debounce works by delaying the execution of a function until a certain amount of time has passed without it being called. This delay can be set to any amount of time, but is typically set to a few milliseconds. When the delay time has elapsed, the function is executed.

### 3. Implementing Debounce
Debounce can be implemented in JavaScript using the setTimeout() method. The setTimeout() method takes two arguments: a callback function and a delay time in milliseconds. The callback function is the function that will be executed after the delay time has elapsed.

### 4. Example
Here is an example of how to implement debounce in JavaScript:
```
let timer;
function debounce(func, delay) {
  clearTimeout(timer);
  timer = setTimeout(func, delay);
}
```
In this example, the debounce function takes a callback function (func) and a delay time (delay) as arguments. The clearTimeout() method is used to clear any existing timer. Then, a new timer is set using the setTimeout() method. The callback function will be executed after the delay time has elapsed.
