[TOC]

**Section 1: Comparing with == and === Operators**

The == and === operators can be used to compare strings in JavaScript. The == operator compares the values of two strings, while the === operator compares both the values and the types of the strings. 

**Section 2: Comparing with String.prototype.localeCompare()**

The String.prototype.localeCompare() method can be used to compare strings in JavaScript. This method returns a number indicating whether a reference string comes before or after or is the same as the given string in the sort order.

**Section 3: Comparing with String.prototype.includes()**

The String.prototype.includes() method can be used to check if a string contains a substring. This method returns a boolean value indicating whether the string contains the substring or not.

**Section 4: Comparing with String.prototype.match()**

The String.prototype.match() method can be used to compare strings in JavaScript. This method searches a string for a match against a regular expression, and returns an array containing the results of the search.
