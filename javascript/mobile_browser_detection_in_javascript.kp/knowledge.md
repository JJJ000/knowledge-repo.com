# Option 1: Using the User Agent

The user agent is a string of data that a web browser sends to the server when making a request. It contains information about the browser and the device it is running on. By looking at the user agent, it is possible to detect if the user is using a mobile device.

# Option 2: Using Media Queries

Media queries allow web developers to detect the size and resolution of the user's device and adjust the layout accordingly. This can be used to detect if the user is using a mobile device and adjust the page accordingly.

# Option 3: Using the Viewport

The viewport is the area of a web page that is visible to the user. By checking the size of the viewport, it is possible to detect if the user is using a mobile device.

# Option 4: Using JavaScript Libraries

There are several JavaScript libraries available that can detect if the user is using a mobile device. These libraries typically use a combination of the methods mentioned above to detect if the user is using a mobile device.
