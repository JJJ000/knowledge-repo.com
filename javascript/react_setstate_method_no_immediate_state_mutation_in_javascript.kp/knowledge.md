tldr: Calling setState is asynchronous, so the state is not immediately mutated.

#1 Explanation

The React setState method does not mutate the state immediately because React is designed to be asynchronous. React uses a batching mechanism to ensure that multiple setState calls are batched together and applied in an atomic way. This means that the state is not updated until the batching process is complete.

#2 Benefits

The primary benefit of this asynchronous behavior is improved performance. If React were to update the state immediately after each setState call, it would cause unnecessary re-renders, which can significantly slow down the application. By batching setState calls, React can ensure that the state is only updated once, resulting in fewer re-renders and improved performance.

#3 State Updates

Another benefit of the asynchronous behavior is that it allows React to perform more complex state updates. For example, if a setState call depended on the current state, React would need to wait until the batching process is complete before applying the update. This allows React to ensure that the state update is applied correctly, even if the state has changed in the meantime.

#4 Future Updates

Finally, the asynchronous behavior of React setState ensures that future updates to the state will not be affected by the current update. This is important because it allows React to ensure that state updates are applied in the correct order, even if the order of setState calls is not known in advance.
