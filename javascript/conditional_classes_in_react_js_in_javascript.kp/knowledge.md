[TOC]

# Section 1: Using classnames

Using the classnames library, you can conditionally apply class attributes in React Js. This library is supported by React and allows you to conditionally apply class attributes in an efficient and maintainable way. 

# Section 2: Using the ternary operator

You can also use the ternary operator to conditionally apply class attributes in React Js. This approach is more concise and requires less code than the classnames library, but it can become difficult to maintain if you have multiple conditionals. 

# Section 3: Using inline styling

In addition to the above methods, you can also use inline styling to conditionally apply class attributes in React Js. This approach is useful when you need to apply styles that are not supported by classnames or the ternary operator, such as hover effects. 

# Section 4: Using the switch statement

Finally, you can also use the switch statement to conditionally apply class attributes in React Js. This approach is useful when you have multiple conditionals and need to apply different classes depending on the condition.
