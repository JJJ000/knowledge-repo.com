`**` Using Promises**

Promises are a great way to handle asynchronous calls in Javascript. With Promises, you can return the response from an asynchronous call by using the `then` method. This method takes a callback function as its parameter, which will be executed when the asynchronous call returns a response. Inside the callback function, you can access the response from the asynchronous call and return it from the function. 

`**` Using Async/Await**

Another way to handle asynchronous calls in Javascript is by using the `async`/`await` keywords. With this approach, you can use the `await` keyword to wait for the asynchronous call to return a response before continuing. Then, you can assign the response to a variable and return it from the function. 

`**` Using Callback Functions**

A third way to handle asynchronous calls in Javascript is by using callback functions. With this approach, you can pass a callback function as an argument to the asynchronous call. The callback function will be executed when the asynchronous call returns a response, and you can access the response from the callback function and return it from the function. 

`**` Using Event Listeners**

The final way to handle asynchronous calls in Javascript is by using event listeners. With this approach, you can attach an event listener to the asynchronous call. The event listener will be triggered when the asynchronous call returns a response, and you can access the response from the event listener and return it from the function.
