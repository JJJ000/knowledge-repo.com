# Section 1 - File Size Validation

JavaScript can be used to validate the size of uploaded files. To do this, the file size must first be determined. This can be done using the `size` property of the `File` object, which returns the size of the file in bytes.

Once the size of the file is known, it can be compared to an expected size. If the size is larger than the expected size, an error can be thrown and the file can be rejected.

# Section 2 - File Object Properties

The `File` object contains several properties that can be used to validate the size of an uploaded file. The most commonly used property is the `size` property, which returns the size of the file in bytes. Additionally, the `name` property can be used to get the name of the file, and the `type` property can be used to get the file type.

# Section 3 - Error Handling

When validating file size, it is important to handle errors appropriately. If the file size is larger than the expected size, an error should be thrown and the file should be rejected. Additionally, if the file type is not supported, an error should be thrown and the file should be rejected.

# Section 4 - Conclusion

JavaScript can be used to validate the size of uploaded files. The `size` property of the `File` object can be used to get the size of the file, and the `name` and `type` properties can be used to get the name and type of the file. If the file size is larger than the expected size, or the file type is not supported, an error should be thrown and the file should be rejected.
