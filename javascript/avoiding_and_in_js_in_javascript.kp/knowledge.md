#### Readability

Increment and decrement operators can make code more difficult to read and understand, especially for novice developers. This is because the operators can often be used interchangeably with other operators, making it difficult to determine which operation is being performed.

#### Performance

Increment and decrement operators can be more computationally expensive than other operators, as they require additional instructions to be performed. This can lead to slower code execution and reduced performance.

#### Clarity

Increment and decrement operators can make code more difficult to debug, as they can often be used interchangeably with other operators. This can lead to confusion when attempting to trace the source of an issue.

#### Alternatives

There are alternatives to increment and decrement operators which can provide more clarity. For example, using the addition and subtraction operators (+ and -) can make code more readable and easier to debug.
