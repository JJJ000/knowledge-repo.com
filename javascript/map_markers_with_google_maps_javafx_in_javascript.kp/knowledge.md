1. Overview
This answer will provide a detailed explanation on how to display a marker on Google Maps using JavaFX and JavaScript.

2. Setting up the Project
In order to display a marker on Google Maps using JavaFX and JavaScript, you will need to set up a project that includes the Google Maps JavaScript API, the JavaFX library, and the JavaFX WebView component.

3. Adding the Marker
Once the project is set up, you can then add a marker to the map by creating a JavaScript function that takes the latitude and longitude of the marker as parameters. This function should then use the Google Maps API to create a marker at the given coordinates.

4. Displaying the Marker
Finally, you can use the JavaFX WebView component to display the Google Maps page with the marker. To do this, you will need to add an event listener to the JavaFX button that will call the JavaScript function when the button is clicked. This will display the marker on the map.
