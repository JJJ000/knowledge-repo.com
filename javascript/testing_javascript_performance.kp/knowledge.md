# 1. Automated Performance Testing
Automated performance testing is a process of using software to measure the performance of a system under a certain workload. It is used to measure the speed, scalability, and stability of an application. Automated performance testing can be used to test JavaScript code by using a tool such as Selenium. Selenium is an open-source tool that is used to automate web browsers and test web applications. It can be used to run performance tests on JavaScript code by running the code in different browsers and recording the results.

# 2. Manual Performance Testing
Manual performance testing is a process of manually measuring the performance of a system under a certain workload. It is used to measure the speed, scalability, and stability of an application. Manual performance testing can be used to test JavaScript code by running the code in different browsers and recording the results.

# 3. Profiling Tools
Profiling tools are used to identify performance bottlenecks in an application. These tools can be used to measure the performance of JavaScript code by measuring the time it takes to execute certain functions or code blocks. This can be used to identify areas of the code that need to be optimized for better performance.

# 4. Benchmarking Tools
Benchmarking tools are used to compare the performance of different versions of an application. These tools can be used to compare the performance of different versions of JavaScript code by measuring the time it takes to execute certain functions or code blocks. This can be used to identify areas of the code that need to be optimized for better performance.
