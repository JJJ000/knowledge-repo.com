[TOC]

**Section 1: Overview**

Passing a JavaScript function as a parameter is a common technique used in JavaScript programming. This allows developers to create functions that are more flexible and can be used in different contexts. By passing a function as a parameter, developers can create functions that can take different arguments and produce different results.

**Section 2: Syntax**

The syntax for passing a JavaScript function as a parameter is as follows: 

```javascript
functionName(parameterName, callbackFunction) {
  // code to be executed
}
```

The parameterName is the name of the parameter that will be passed to the function, and the callbackFunction is the JavaScript function that will be passed as a parameter.

**Section 3: Example**

For example, consider a function that takes two numbers and returns the sum:

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Now, we can pass this function as a parameter to another function:

```javascript
function doSomething(x, y, callbackFunction) {
  let result = callbackFunction(x, y);
  console.log(result);
}

doSomething(2, 3, add); // prints 5
```

**Section 4: Benefits**

Passing a JavaScript function as a parameter has several benefits. It allows developers to create code that is more reusable and can be used in different contexts. Additionally, it allows developers to create more flexible functions that can take different arguments and produce different results. Finally, it makes it easier for developers to create complex programs that are easier to maintain and debug.
