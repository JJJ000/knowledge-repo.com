## href
The `href` attribute is used to specify the URL of the page the link should go to. It is used to create links between pages. When a user clicks on the link, the browser will request the specified URL from the web server and display the page in the browser window.

## onclick
The `onclick` attribute is used to specify a JavaScript function that should be executed when the link is clicked. This allows you to create more interactive links, as the JavaScript function can be used to perform any action you want.

## Advantages of href
- Easy to use and understand
- Can be used to link to any page on the web

## Advantages of onclick
- Allows for more interactivity
- Can be used to perform any action you want
