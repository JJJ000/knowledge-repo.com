## Properties
Properties are the values associated with an HTML element. They are used to manipulate the element's behavior, appearance, or content. Properties are set using JavaScript and can be accessed using the dot notation or bracket notation.

## Attributes
Attributes are the values associated with an HTML element that are set in the HTML code. They are used to provide additional information about the element, and can be accessed using the getAttribute() method. Attributes do not have any effect on the element's behavior or appearance, and are generally used to provide additional information about the element.
