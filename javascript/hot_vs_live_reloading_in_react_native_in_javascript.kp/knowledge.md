# Hot Reloading
Hot reloading is a feature of React Native which allows developers to quickly view changes they make to the code in the app without having to recompile and deploy the app. It works by detecting changes made to the code and automatically reloading the app with the new code.

# Live Reloading
Live reloading is similar to hot reloading, however it reloads the entire app instead of just the changed code. This allows developers to view changes to their app in real time without having to recompile and deploy the app. Additionally, live reloading can be used to debug the app in real time.
