tldr: You can use the `.split()` method to create an array of each letter of text and then use a `for` loop to process each element of the array.

## Using for loop

The most common way to process each letter of text using Javascript is to use a for loop. This loop will iterate through each character in the text and can be used to perform any desired operations on each letter.

```
for (let i = 0; i < text.length; i++) {
  const letter = text[i];
  // Do something with letter
}
```

## Using forEach

Another way to process each letter of text is to use the forEach method. This method will iterate through each character and execute a callback function for each letter.

```
text.split('').forEach(letter => {
  // Do something with letter
});
```

## Using map

The map method can also be used to process each letter of text. This method will iterate through each character and return a new array with the result of the callback function for each letter.

```
const result = text.split('').map(letter => {
  // Do something with letter
});
```

## Using reduce

Finally, the reduce method can be used to process each letter of text. This method will iterate through each character and return a single value with the result of the callback function for each letter.

```
const result = text.split('').reduce((acc, letter) => {
  // Do something with letter
  return acc;
}, 0);
```
