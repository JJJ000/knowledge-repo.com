tldr: Classes in JavaScript can be defined using either the class syntax or the prototype syntax; the trade-off is that the class syntax is easier to read and use, but the prototype syntax is more powerful.

### ES5 Class Definition

ES5 (ECMAScript 5) is the version of JavaScript that was released in 2009. This version of JavaScript introduced the ability to define classes using the `function` keyword. This class definition technique is the most widely used and is the most widely supported. 

The trade-off of this technique is that it is more verbose than other techniques, and can be difficult to read and debug.

### ES2015 Class Definition

ES2015 (also known as ES6) is the version of JavaScript that was released in 2015. This version of JavaScript introduced the ability to define classes using the `class` keyword. This class definition technique is the newer and more modern way to define classes. 

The trade-off of this technique is that it is not supported in all browsers and requires a transpiler like Babel to be used in order to use it in older browsers.

### Prototype-based Class Definition

Prototype-based class definition is a technique where classes are defined using the `Object.create()` method. This technique allows for classes to be defined in a more concise manner than using the `function` or `class` keyword.

The trade-off of this technique is that it is not as widely supported as the other methods and can be difficult to debug and read.
