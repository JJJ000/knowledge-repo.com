### Definition

Cannot read property 'setState' of undefined is an error that occurs when trying to access the `setState` method of a React component, but the component is `undefined`. `setState` is a method used to update the state of a React component, which is used to trigger a re-render of the component and any of its child components.

### Causes

This error usually occurs when a React component is referenced before it is defined. This can happen if a component is imported incorrectly or if a component is referenced before it is declared. It can also occur if a component is not passed down correctly through React's props system.

### Solutions

The best way to fix this error is to ensure that all components are imported correctly and that all components are referenced after they are declared. If a component is being passed down through props, it is important to make sure that it is being passed down correctly. Additionally, it is important to make sure that the component is not `undefined` before trying to access its `setState` method.
