# Section 1: Getting the Current Time

The first step in detecting idle time in JavaScript is to get the current time. This can be done using the Date object.

```javascript
var currentTime = new Date();
```

# Section 2: Setting a Timer

Once you have the current time, you can set a timer to check for idle time. This can be done using the setTimeout() function. This function takes two parameters: a callback function and a delay in milliseconds.

```javascript
setTimeout(function(){
    // Check for idle time
}, 5000); // Check for idle time every 5 seconds
```

# Section 3: Checking for Idle Time

The callback function can then be used to check for idle time. This can be done by comparing the current time with the time when the page was last interacted with. If the difference is greater than a certain threshold, then it can be assumed that the user is idle.

```javascript
var lastInteractionTime = new Date(); // Set this when the page is interacted with

setTimeout(function(){
    var currentTime = new Date();
    var idleTime = currentTime - lastInteractionTime;
    if (idleTime > threshold) {
        // User is idle
    }
}, 5000);
```

# Section 4: Responding to Idle Time

Once idle time has been detected, you can then respond accordingly. This could be anything from displaying a message to the user, to redirecting them to another page.

```javascript
var lastInteractionTime = new Date();

setTimeout(function(){
    var currentTime = new Date();
    var idleTime = currentTime - lastInteractionTime;
    if (idleTime > threshold) {
        alert('You have been idle for too long!');
        window.location.href = 'http://example.com';
    }
}, 5000);
```
