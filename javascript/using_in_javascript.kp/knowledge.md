# String Interpolation
The backtick character is used to denote a template literal, which is a special type of string that makes string interpolation easier. Template literals use the backtick character to enclose the string and allow for the use of placeholders, denoted by `${expression}`, which are evaluated and replaced with their corresponding values. 

# Multiline Strings
The backtick character also allows for the creation of multiline strings, which is not possible with single or double quotes. With the backtick character, line breaks are preserved when the string is evaluated, allowing for easier readability of longer strings.

# Escaping Characters
The backtick character is also used to escape characters within a string. For example, if a string contains a backtick character, it must be preceded by a backslash (`\`) in order to be interpreted correctly.
