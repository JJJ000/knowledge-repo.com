# Section 1: Setting up the Headers

The first step in using basic authentication with jQuery and Ajax is to set up the headers. This is done by using the `$.ajaxSetup()` method.

```javascript
$.ajaxSetup({
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Basic ' + btoa('username:password')
  }
});
```

The `btoa()` function is used to encode the username and password into a base-64 string.

# Section 2: Making the Request

Once the headers have been set up, the actual request can be made. This is done by using the `$.ajax()` method.

```javascript
$.ajax({
  url: 'http://example.com/api/endpoint',
  method: 'GET',
  success: function(data) {
    // handle the response data
  }
});
```

# Section 3: Handling Errors

It is important to handle any errors that may occur when making the request. This can be done by using the `error` option in the `$.ajax()` method.

```javascript
$.ajax({
  url: 'http://example.com/api/endpoint',
  method: 'GET',
  success: function(data) {
    // handle the response data
  },
  error: function(xhr, status, error) {
    // handle the error
  }
});
```

# Section 4: Cleaning Up

Finally, it is important to clean up after the request has been made. This is done by using the `$.ajaxSetup()` method again to remove the authorization header.

```javascript
$.ajaxSetup({
  headers: {
    'Authorization': null
  }
});
```
