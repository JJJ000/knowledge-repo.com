## Single-Threaded Execution Model

JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning that only one thread can be executed at a time. This means that while one thread is running, all other threads must wait until the first thread is finished before they can execute. This single-threaded model prevents JavaScript from supporting multi-threading.

## Lack of Thread Creation and Management APIs

JavaScript does not have any APIs for creating and managing multiple threads. Without these APIs, it is impossible to create and manage multiple threads in JavaScript.

## Performance and Memory Issues

Multi-threading can cause performance and memory issues. Multiple threads running at the same time can lead to race conditions, deadlocks, and other issues. Additionally, multi-threading requires more resources, such as memory, which can lead to slower performance.

## Security Issues

Multi-threading can also introduce security issues. If multiple threads are running at the same time, there is a greater chance for malicious code to be executed. This can lead to data corruption or other security issues.
