## No

There is no built-in RegExp.escape function in JavaScript.

## What it Does

The RegExp.escape function is used to escape special characters in a string so it can be used as a literal string in a regular expression.

## Alternative Solutions

There are several alternative methods for escaping special characters in strings for use in regular expressions. 

One popular method is to use the `String.replace()` method to replace special characters with their escaped counterparts. Another option is to use a library such as [XRegExp](http://xregexp.com/) which provides an `XRegExp.escape()` function for escaping strings.
