tldr: Currying is a technique in JavaScript where a function is broken down into a series of functions that each take a single argument.

## Definition

Currying is a programming technique that involves transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument. 

## Example

For example, a function that takes two arguments, `x` and `y`, can be transformed into a function that takes a single argument `x` and returns a function that takes a single argument `y`. 

## Benefits

The primary benefit of currying is that it allows for the creation of more specialized functions from existing functions. By transforming a function with multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take a single argument, more specific functions can be created from the original function. This can be useful for creating a library of functions that can be reused in different contexts. 

## Use Cases

Currying is often used in functional programming, as it allows for the creation of higher-order functions that can be used to compose other functions. Additionally, currying can be used to create more specialized functions that can be used to reduce code complexity and improve code readability.
