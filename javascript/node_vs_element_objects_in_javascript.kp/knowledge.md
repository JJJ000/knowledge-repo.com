#### Node Object
A Node object represents a single node in the DOM tree. It is an abstract object that is not directly displayed in the browser. The Node object contains properties and methods for accessing and manipulating the node and its child nodes.

#### Element Object
An Element object represents an element in the DOM tree. It is an object that is directly displayed on the page. The Element object contains properties and methods for accessing and manipulating the element and its child elements.
