[TOC]

Yes, there are constants in JavaScript.

## What is a Constant?

A constant is a value that cannot be changed. It is a variable that has been declared with the `const` keyword.

## What are the Benefits of Using Constants?

Using constants can help improve code readability and maintainability. It also helps to prevent accidental changes to the value of a variable.

## What are the Limitations of Using Constants?

Constants are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once they are declared. Additionally, constants are limited to a single scope, meaning they cannot be accessed outside of the scope in which they were declared.
