#1 Using Cache-Busting
Cache-busting is a technique used to force the browser to reload a file from the server instead of using the cached version. This can be done by appending a query string parameter to the URL of the JavaScript file. For example, if the JavaScript file was called "script.js", the URL would be modified to "script.js?v=1.0".

#2 Using HTTP Headers
Another way to force the browser to reload a JavaScript file is to use HTTP headers. The Cache-Control header can be used to set the caching policy for the file. For example, the header can be set to "no-cache" to ensure that the browser always downloads the latest version of the file from the server.

#3 Using a Version Number
A third way to force the browser to reload a JavaScript file is to use a version number. This can be done by appending a version number to the URL of the JavaScript file. For example, if the JavaScript file was called "script.js", the URL would be modified to "script.js?v=1.0". The version number can then be incremented each time the file is updated, ensuring that the browser always downloads the latest version.

#4 Using a Timestamp
Finally, another way to force the browser to reload a JavaScript file is to use a timestamp. This can be done by appending a timestamp to the URL of the JavaScript file. For example, if the JavaScript file was called "script.js", the URL would be modified to "script.js?t=123456789". The timestamp can then be updated each time the file is updated, ensuring that the browser always downloads the latest version.
