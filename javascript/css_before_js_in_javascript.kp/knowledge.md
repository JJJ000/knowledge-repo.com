##CSS
CSS is a styling language that is used to style the presentation of a web page. It is used to define the look and feel of a website. It is also used to create layouts and other visual effects.

##JavaScript
JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to add interactivity to web pages. It is used to create dynamic content and to interact with the user. It can also be used to create animations and other effects.

##Order
The order of CSS and JavaScript does not matter. CSS can be placed before or after JavaScript. It is up to the developer to decide which order to use. The only thing that matters is that the code is valid and works correctly.
