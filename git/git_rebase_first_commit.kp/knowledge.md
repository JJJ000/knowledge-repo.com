#1 Assessing the Situation

Before attempting to rebase the first commit, it is important to assess the current state of the repository. This includes looking at the commits that have already been made, the branches that exist, and any conflicts that may arise from the rebase.

#2 Preparing to Rebase

Before rebasing, it is important to create a backup of the repository in case something goes wrong. This can be done by creating a new branch or by pushing the repository to a remote.

#3 Rebase the First Commit

Once the repository is backed up, the first commit can be rebased. This can be done by using the `git rebase` command followed by the commit hash of the first commit.

#4 Push the Rebased Commit

Once the first commit is rebased, it can be pushed to the remote repository. This is done by using the `git push` command followed by the remote name.
