### Introduction

Forking a public repository on GitHub allows you to make a copy of the existing repository and host it on your own private account. This allows you to make changes to the repository without affecting the original public repository.

### Steps for Making a Fork of a Public Repository Private

1. Log into your GitHub account and navigate to the public repository you want to fork.

2. Click the “Fork” button in the top-right corner of the page.

3. Once the repository is forked, click the “Settings” tab in the left sidebar.

4. Scroll down to the “Danger Zone” section and click the “Make Private” button.

5. Confirm your selection by clicking the “I understand the consequences, make this repository private” button.

### Conclusion

By following the steps above, you can make a fork of a public repository private on GitHub. This will allow you to make changes to the repository without affecting the original public repository.
