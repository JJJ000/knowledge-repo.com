# Git Am
Git am is a command used to apply a series of patches from a mailbox. It is typically used to apply a series of patches from a mailing list or from a patch series stored in a file.

# Git Apply
Git apply is a command used to apply a patch to the current working tree. It can be used to apply a single patch or a patch series stored in a file.

# Difference
The main difference between git am and git apply is that git am is used to apply a series of patches from a mailbox, while git apply is used to apply a single patch or a patch series stored in a file. Additionally, git am also performs additional actions such as committing the patch and adding it to the index. Git apply only applies the patch and does not commit it or add it to the index.
