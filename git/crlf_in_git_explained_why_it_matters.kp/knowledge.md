[TOC]

### What is CRLF?
CRLF stands for Carriage Return Line Feed. It is a special sequence of two ASCII characters used to indicate the end of a line of text.

### What is LF?
LF stands for Line Feed. It is a single ASCII character used to indicate the end of a line of text.

### What is the difference between CRLF and LF?
The difference between CRLF and LF is that CRLF consists of two characters (carriage return and line feed) while LF is only one character (line feed).

### Is it important?
Yes, it is important to use the correct line endings in git. If the line endings are not consistent, it can cause problems with the version control system. For example, if a file contains both CRLF and LF line endings, git will not be able to properly track the changes made to the file.
