### Option 1: Pulling from the Upstream Repository

This option involves regularly pulling from the upstream repository to keep your local copy in sync. This can be done by running the `git pull` command from the terminal.

### Option 2: Rebasing

Rebasing is a powerful tool for keeping your fork in sync without adding a separate remote. This involves taking the changes from the upstream repository and applying them to your local repository. This can be done by running the `git rebase` command from the terminal.

### Option 3: Merging

Merging is another way to keep your fork in sync without adding a separate remote. This involves taking the changes from the upstream repository and merging them into your local repository. This can be done by running the `git merge` command from the terminal.

### Option 4: Using the GitHub Desktop App

The GitHub Desktop app provides a graphical user interface for managing your local repository. It provides an easy way to keep your fork in sync without adding a separate remote. The app can be downloaded from the official GitHub website.
