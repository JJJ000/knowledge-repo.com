# Introduction

Git Blame Commit Statistics is a tool used to track changes to a codebase over time. It allows developers to analyze the history of a project, identify the authors of each change, and determine the overall impact of a particular commit. This tool is especially useful for debugging, as it can help pinpoint the exact source of a bug or issue.

# How it Works

Git Blame Commit Statistics works by tracking the changes made to a codebase over time. Whenever a change is made, the tool records the author, date, and other details related to the commit. This information is stored in a database that can be accessed and analyzed by developers.

# Benefits

Git Blame Commit Statistics offers several benefits to developers. By tracking the changes made to a codebase over time, developers can easily identify the source of a bug or issue. This can help speed up the debugging process, as developers can quickly pinpoint the exact cause of the problem. Additionally, this tool can be used to track the contributions of individual developers, allowing them to be rewarded for their hard work.

# Limitations

Git Blame Commit Statistics does have some limitations. For example, it can be difficult to track changes made to a codebase if the authors do not use a consistent naming convention for their commits. Additionally, this tool does not provide any insight into the quality of the code, as it only tracks the changes made to the codebase.
