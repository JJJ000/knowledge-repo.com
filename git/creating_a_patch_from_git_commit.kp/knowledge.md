# Section 1: Check for Uncommitted Changes

Before creating a patch, it is important to check for any uncommitted changes. This can be done by running the command `git status`. This will inform you of any changes that have not yet been committed.

# Section 2: Create a Patch

Once you have checked for any uncommitted changes, a patch can be created by running the command `git format-patch -1`. This will create a patch file for the latest commit which can be shared with other people.

# Section 3: Apply the Patch

To apply the patch, the recipient of the patch will need to run the command `git apply <patch-file>`. This will apply the patch to the local repository.

# Section 4: Commit the Changes

Once the patch has been applied, the recipient will need to commit the changes by running the command `git commit -a`. This will commit the changes and make them part of the local repository.
