# Section 1: Overview

Git Revert is a command used to undo changes to a file or files in a Git repository. This command can be used to reverse changes to a single file, multiple files, or even an entire commit. It is important to note that the revert command does not delete the changes, but instead creates a new commit with the opposite changes.

# Section 2: Syntax

The syntax for the git revert command is as follows:

```
git revert <commit>
```

Where <commit> is the commit that you want to revert.

# Section 3: Examples

To revert a single file, use the following command:

```
git revert HEAD -- <file>
```

Where <file> is the file that you want to revert.

To revert multiple files, use the following command:

```
git revert HEAD -- <file1> <file2> <file3>
```

Where <file1>, <file2>, and <file3> are the files that you want to revert.

# Section 4: Tips

It is important to note that the git revert command does not delete the changes, but instead creates a new commit with the opposite changes. This means that the changes you are reverting will still be visible in the repositoryâ€™s history.

It is also important to be careful when using the git revert command, as it can easily undo changes that you may not have intended to undo. It is a good practice to use the git diff command to review the changes that will be reverted before executing the git revert command.
