### Method 1: Using the `git reset` Command
The `git reset` command can be used to unstage a file in Git. This command takes the file out of the staging area and returns it to its pre-staged state.

### Method 2: Using the `git rm` Command
The `git rm` command can be used to unstage a file in Git. This command removes the file from the staging area and deletes it from the working directory.
