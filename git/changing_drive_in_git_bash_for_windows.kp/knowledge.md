#Section 1: Change Drive

To change the drive in Git Bash for Windows, you can use the `cd` command followed by the drive letter. For example, `cd C:` will change to the C drive.

#Section 2: Navigate Directories

Once you have changed to the desired drive, you can navigate to the desired directory using the `cd` command followed by the path to the directory. For example, `cd Documents\Projects` will change to the Projects directory in the Documents folder.

#Section 3: View Current Directory

To view the current directory, you can use the `pwd` command. This will print the full path of the current directory to the terminal.

#Section 4: List Directories and Files

To list the directories and files in the current directory, you can use the `ls` command. This will list all of the directories and files in the current directory.
