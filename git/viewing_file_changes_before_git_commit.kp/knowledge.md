### Using Git Diff

Git diff is a command that allows you to view the differences between two versions of a file. This can be used to view the changes made to a file before committing to Git.

### Syntax

The syntax for using git diff is as follows:

`git diff <file>`

This will compare the current version of the file to the version that is staged for commit.

### Output

The output of the git diff command will show the differences between the two versions of the file. The output will be in a unified diff format, which shows the lines that have been added, removed, or changed.

### Example

For example, if you have made changes to a file called `myfile.txt` and want to view the changes before committing them to Git, you can use the command:

`git diff myfile.txt`

This will output the differences between the current version of the file and the version that is staged for commit.
