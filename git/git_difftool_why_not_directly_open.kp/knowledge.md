1. What is Git Difftool?
Git difftool is a command line utility that allows users to compare the differences between two versions of a file or between two different files. It is part of the Git version control system, which is used to manage source code changes over time.

2. How Does Git Difftool Work?
Git difftool works by comparing two versions of a file or two different files and displaying the differences between them in a graphical interface. The user can then choose to accept or reject the differences, and the changes can be committed to the repository.

3. Why Does Git Difftool Not Open the Tool Directly?
Git difftool does not open the tool directly because it is a command line utility. It is designed to be used in combination with other Git commands, such as git add and git commit. This allows users to make changes to the repository in a more controlled manner.

4. Conclusion
Git difftool is a useful command line utility for comparing the differences between two versions of a file or two different files. However, it does not open the tool directly because it is designed to be used in combination with other Git commands.
