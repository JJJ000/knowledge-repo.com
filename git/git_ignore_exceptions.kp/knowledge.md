### Excluding Files Manually

Git allows you to manually exclude certain files from being tracked. To do this, add the file path to the `.gitignore` file.

### Excluding Files Globally

Git also allows you to exclude files from being tracked globally. To do this, create a `.gitignore_global` file in your home directory and add the file paths that you want to exclude.

### Excluding Directories

Git allows you to exclude entire directories from being tracked. To do this, add the directory path to the `.gitignore` file.

### Excluding Subdirectories

Git also allows you to exclude specific subdirectories from being tracked. To do this, add the subdirectory path to the `.gitignore` file.
