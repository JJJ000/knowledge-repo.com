### Overview

GitHub pull requests are a great way to collaborate on projects with other developers. When creating a pull request, you can see a list of commits that are already in the target branch. This allows you to ensure that all changes have been properly merged into the target branch before submitting the pull request.

### How to View Commits Already in Target Branch

1. Navigate to the pull request page for the project.

2. Select the “Files changed” tab.

3. Scroll down to the “Commits” section.

4. Click the “Show all commits” link.

5. A list of commits already in the target branch will be displayed.

### Benefits of Viewing Commits Already in Target Branch

Viewing commits already in the target branch can be beneficial in a few different ways. First, it can help to ensure that all changes have been properly merged into the target branch before submitting the pull request. This can help to avoid any potential conflicts or issues with the pull request. Additionally, it can help to identify any potential issues with the code that may have been overlooked. Finally, it can help to ensure that all changes are properly documented and tracked.
