### No

The `node_modules` folder should not be included in the git repository. This folder contains all the dependencies and packages installed using npm or yarn. It is not necessary to include this folder in the repository since it can be easily installed using the package manager.

### Why

The `node_modules` folder is usually large in size and can take up a lot of space in the repository. It is also unnecessary to include this folder since it can be easily installed using the package manager.

### Alternatives

Instead of including the `node_modules` folder in the repository, it is better to include `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files. These files contain all the necessary information about the dependencies and packages required for the project. The package manager can then use these files to install the necessary packages.
