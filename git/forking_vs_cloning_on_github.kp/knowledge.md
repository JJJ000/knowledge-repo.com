# Forking
Forking is the process of creating a copy of a repository in your own GitHub account. This allows you to make changes to the code without affecting the original repository. You can then submit a pull request to the original repository if you want the changes to be incorporated into the original code.

# Cloning
Cloning is the process of downloading a copy of a repository from GitHub to your local machine. This allows you to work on the code locally and then push the changes back to the repository on GitHub.
