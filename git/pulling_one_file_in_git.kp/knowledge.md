Yes, it is possible to pull just one file in Git.

## Steps
1. Navigate to the directory containing the file you want to pull.
2. Run the `git pull` command.
3. Specify the file you want to pull with the `-- <filename>` flag.

## Example
```
$ cd path/to/my/repo
$ git pull -- my_file.txt
```

## Notes
- The `git pull` command will pull all changes from the remote repository, but only the specified file will be updated in the local repository.
- If the file does not exist in the remote repository, the command will fail.
