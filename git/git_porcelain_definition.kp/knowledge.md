### Definition

Porcelain is a term used to refer to Git commands that have a consistent user interface across different versions of Git. These commands are typically considered to be higher-level and easier to use than the plumbing commands.

### Examples

Some examples of porcelain commands are `git branch`, `git checkout`, `git commit`, `git diff`, `git log`, `git merge`, `git reset`, and `git status`.

### Benefits

The benefit of using porcelain commands is that they provide a consistent user interface across different versions of Git. This makes it easier to learn and use Git, since the commands will work the same regardless of the version of Git you are using.

### Limitations

The main limitation of porcelain commands is that they are higher-level and may not provide as much control as the plumbing commands. Additionally, some of the porcelain commands may not be available in older versions of Git.
