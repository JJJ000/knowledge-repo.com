[TOC]

Yes, it is possible to include a file in your .gitconfig.

## Method 1

The first method is to directly include the file in the .gitconfig. The file should be located in the same directory as the .gitconfig. The file should be referenced in the .gitconfig using the `include` keyword followed by the path to the file.

## Method 2

The second method is to create a reference to the file in the .gitconfig. This can be done by adding a `[include]` section to the .gitconfig and adding a reference to the file in the form of `path = path/to/file.ext`. This reference can then be used in the .gitconfig by using the `$include` keyword followed by the path to the file.

## Method 3

The third method is to create a symlink to the file in the .gitconfig. This can be done by creating a symlink to the file in the same directory as the .gitconfig. The symlink should then be referenced in the .gitconfig using the `include` keyword followed by the path to the symlink.

## Method 4

The fourth method is to use the `git config --file` command to include the file in the .gitconfig. This can be done by running the command `git config --file path/to/file.ext` followed by the path to the file. The file should then be referenced in the .gitconfig using the `include` keyword followed by the path to the file.
