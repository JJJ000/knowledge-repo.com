# Staging a Commit

## Step 1: Check the Status

Before staging a commit, it is important to check the status of the repository. This can be done by running `git status` in the command line. This will provide information about the current branch, any changes that have been made, and any untracked files.

## Step 2: Stage the Commit

Once the status has been checked, the commit can be staged with the `git add` command. This command will add the changes to the staging area, which is a temporary area that stores changes before they are committed to the repository.

## Step 3: Commit the Changes

The next step is to commit the changes to the repository. This can be done with the `git commit` command, which will create a commit with a message that describes the changes that were made.

## Step 4: Push the Commit

The final step is to push the commit to the remote repository. This can be done with the `git push` command, which will push the commit to the remote repository and make it available to other users.
