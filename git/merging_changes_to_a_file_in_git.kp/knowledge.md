### Step 1: Retrieve the Changes

The first step to merging changes to a single file is to retrieve the changes from the remote repository. This can be done by using the `git fetch` command. This will pull down any new commits that have been made to the remote repository and store them in the local repository.

### Step 2: Check Out the File

Once the changes have been retrieved, the next step is to check out the file that needs to be merged. This can be done by using the `git checkout` command. The command should include the name of the file that needs to be merged, as well as the name of the branch or commit that contains the changes that need to be merged.

### Step 3: Merge the Changes

After the file has been checked out, the changes can be merged into the file. This can be done by using the `git merge` command. The command should include the name of the file that needs to be merged, as well as the name of the branch or commit that contains the changes that need to be merged.

### Step 4: Commit the Changes

Finally, the changes should be committed to the repository. This can be done by using the `git commit` command. The command should include a message describing the changes that were made. Once the changes have been committed, they will be available in the remote repository.
