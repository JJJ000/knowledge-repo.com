### Copy

To copy a file or folder in Git Bash, you can use the `cp` command. This command allows you to specify the source file or folder and the destination. 

For example, to copy a file named `myfile.txt` from the current directory to a folder named `myfolder` in the same directory, you would use the following command:

```
cp myfile.txt myfolder
```

### Paste

To paste a file or folder in Git Bash, you can use the `mv` command. This command allows you to specify the source file or folder and the destination. 

For example, to paste a file named `myfile.txt` from the current directory to a folder named `myfolder` in the same directory, you would use the following command:

```
mv myfile.txt myfolder
```
