### Overview

The Sign Off feature in Git is used to certify that the author of a commit has reviewed and approved the changes in the commit. It is an important part of the Git workflow, ensuring that changes to a project are properly reviewed and accepted before they are merged into the main codebase.

### Usage

To use the Sign Off feature, the author of a commit must add a line to the commit message that reads "Signed-off-by: [Name] <[Email]>". This line should be added after the commit message and before any other lines in the commit message.

### Benefits

Using the Sign Off feature provides a number of benefits to the development team. First, it ensures that each commit is reviewed and accepted by the author before it is merged into the main codebase. This helps to reduce the risk of errors or bugs being introduced into the project.

Second, it provides a record of who approved a commit, which can be useful for tracking down any issues that arise from the changes. This can also be helpful when trying to understand why a particular change was made.

Finally, it helps to ensure that all changes to the project are properly documented and tracked. This can be useful for debugging or for tracking down the source of a particular bug.
