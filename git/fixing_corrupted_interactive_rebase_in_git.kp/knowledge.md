### Diagnose the Problem

The first step in fixing a corrupted interactive rebase in Git is to diagnose the problem. This can be done by running the command `git reflog` to view the recent history of the repository. This will help identify the last known good commit and the commit that caused the corruption.

### Revert to the Last Known Good Commit

Once the problem commit is identified, the next step is to revert the repository to the last known good commit. This can be done by running `git reset --hard <commit-hash>` where `<commit-hash>` is the hash of the last known good commit.

### Restart the Interactive Rebase

Once the repository is reverted to the last known good commit, the interactive rebase can be restarted. To do this, run the command `git rebase -i <commit-hash>` where `<commit-hash>` is the hash of the commit before the one that caused the corruption.

### Clean Up

Finally, any changes that were made between the last known good commit and the commit that caused the corruption should be cleaned up. This can be done by running `git reset --hard HEAD` to reset the repository to the latest commit.
