1. Download the Git Diff File

First, you will need to download the Git Diff file from the repository you are working on. This file will contain the changes that have been made since the original branch was created.

2. Switch to the Local Branch

Next, you will need to switch to the local branch that is a copy of the same repository. You can do this by running the command `git checkout <branch_name>`.

3. Apply the Git Diff File

Once you have switched to the local branch, you will need to apply the Git Diff file by running the command `git apply <filename>`. This will apply the changes from the Git Diff file to the local branch.

4. Commit the Changes

Finally, you will need to commit the changes that have been applied from the Git Diff file. You can do this by running the command `git commit -m "description of changes"`. This will commit the changes to the local branch.
