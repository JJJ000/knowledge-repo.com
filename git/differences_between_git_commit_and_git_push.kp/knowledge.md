#1 Commit

Git commit is the process of committing changes to a local repository. This is the first step in the Git workflow and is used to save changes to the local repository. When you commit, you are taking a snapshot of the current state of the repository and saving it to the repository's history.

#2 Push

Git push is the process of sending committed changes to a remote repository, such as a server. This is the final step in the Git workflow and is used to make the changes available to others. After pushing, the changes will be visible to anyone with access to the remote repository.

#3 Difference

The main difference between git commit and git push is that git commit only saves the changes to the local repository, while git push sends the changes to a remote repository. Committing is a local operation, while pushing is a remote operation.
