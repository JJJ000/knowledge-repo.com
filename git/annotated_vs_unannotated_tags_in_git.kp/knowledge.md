### Unannotated Tag
An unannotated tag is a simple tag that points to a specific commit. It is just a reference to a commit and does not contain any additional information.

### Annotated Tag
An annotated tag is a more complete tag that includes additional information such as the tagger, date, and message. It is a more complete way to refer to a commit and can be used to provide additional context.
