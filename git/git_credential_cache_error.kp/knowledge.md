### Overview

The term 'credential-cache' is not a git command, but is instead a feature of the git credential helper. The git credential helper is a tool that helps to manage and store user credentials when accessing remote repositories. It is used to securely store credentials for a remote repository, such as a username and password, so that they do not need to be entered each time a user accesses the repository.

### How it Works

The git credential helper stores user credentials in a secure cache, which is then used to authenticate the user when they access the remote repository. When the user attempts to access the remote repository, the git credential helper will check the cache for the userâ€™s credentials. If the credentials are found, the user will be authenticated and allowed access to the repository. If the credentials are not found, the user will be prompted to enter the credentials before being allowed access.

### Benefits

The git credential helper provides several benefits to users. It eliminates the need to repeatedly enter credentials when accessing a remote repository, which can save time and effort. It also helps to keep credentials secure, as they are stored in an encrypted cache, making it more difficult for malicious actors to gain access to the repository.

### Conclusion

The 'credential-cache' feature of the git credential helper is a useful tool for managing user credentials when accessing remote repositories. It eliminates the need to repeatedly enter credentials and helps to keep them secure by storing them in an encrypted cache.
