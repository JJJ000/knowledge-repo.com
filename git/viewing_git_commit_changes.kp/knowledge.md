### Using git log

Using the `git log` command, you can view the changes in a Git commit. This command will display a list of commits, including the commit message, author, date, and any other information associated with the commit. You can use the `--patch` or `-p` option to view the changes in each commit. This will show a diff of the changes that were made in the commit.

### Using git show

You can also use the `git show` command to view the changes in a commit. This command will display the commit message, author, date, and any other information associated with the commit, as well as a diff of the changes that were made in the commit.

### Using git diff

You can also use the `git diff` command to view the changes in a commit. This command will display a diff of the changes that were made in the commit, but it will not show the commit message, author, date, or any other information associated with the commit.
