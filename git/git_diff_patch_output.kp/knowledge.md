[TOC]

1. Using the `--patch` Option 

The `--patch` option allows you to generate a patch-compatible output from `git-diff`. This option can be used to generate a patch file that can be applied to a different repository, or to a different branch of the same repository.

2. Format of the Output 

The output generated by the `--patch` option is in the unified diff format, which is a standard format for patches. This format shows the differences between two files, as well as the context of the changes.

3. Usage Example 

To generate a patch-compatible output from `git-diff`, use the following command:

`git diff --patch <commit1> <commit2>`

Where `<commit1>` and `<commit2>` are the two commits you want to compare. The output will be in the unified diff format, which can then be applied to a different repository or branch.

4. Additional Resources
