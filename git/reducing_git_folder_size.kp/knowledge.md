[TOC]

1. Clean Up Unused Objects
--------------------------------

Git stores all the objects it uses in a local repository, and over time, this can cause the size of the git folder to increase. To reduce the size of the git folder, you can use the `git gc` command to clean up unused objects. This command will remove any objects that are not being used in the current branch and can help reduce the size of the git folder.

2. Prune Remote References
--------------------------------

Git stores references to remote branches in the local repository, and over time, these references can accumulate and cause the size of the git folder to increase. To reduce the size of the git folder, you can use the `git remote prune` command to remove any references to remote branches that have been deleted.

3. Clean Up Unused Large Files
--------------------------------

Git stores all the files that are tracked in the repository, and over time, these files can accumulate and cause the size of the git folder to increase. To reduce the size of the git folder, you can use the `git filter-branch` command to remove any large files that are not being used in the current branch.

4. Optimize Git Packfiles
--------------------------------

Git stores all the objects in packfiles, and over time, these packfiles can become bloated and cause the size of the git folder to increase. To reduce the size of the git folder, you can use the `git repack` command to optimize the packfiles and reduce their size.
