## Git Status
Git is a version control system that keeps track of changes made to files in a repository. When a user runs the `git status` command, it will show the user which files have been changed and which files have not been committed yet. It will also show the user which branch they are currently on.

## Ignore Line Endings
Git is configured to ignore line endings, meaning that it will not consider differences in line endings (CR/LF) when determining if a file has been changed. This is useful for working in both Windows and Linux environments, as the line endings may differ between the two.

## Identical Files
Git will also ignore identical files, meaning that it will not consider two files to be different if they are the same. This is useful when working with Dropbox, as Dropbox will create a new copy of a file when it is edited and stored in a different folder.

## Meld
Meld is a graphical tool used to compare and merge files. It can be used to compare the differences between two files, making it easy to identify changes that have been made. Meld can also be used to merge two versions of a file into one, allowing users to keep track of changes made to a file over time.
