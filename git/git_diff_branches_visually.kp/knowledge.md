# Using diff

The `diff` command can be used to compare the differences between two branches. To do this, the command `diff <branch1> <branch2>` can be used. This will display a list of differences between the two branches.

# Using git diff

The `git diff` command can be used to compare changes between two branches. This command works similarly to the `diff` command, but it can also show the differences between commits. To use this command, run `git diff <branch1> <branch2>`. This will display a list of differences between the two branches.

# Using a visual diff tool

There are several visual diff tools available that can be used to compare the differences between two branches. These tools usually provide a graphical representation of the differences between the two branches, making it easier to identify the changes. Popular tools include Meld, KDiff3, and Beyond Compare.
