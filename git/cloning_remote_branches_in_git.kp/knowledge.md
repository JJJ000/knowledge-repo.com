### Step 1: Fetch All Remote Branches

To clone all remote branches, you first need to fetch all the remote branches. This can be done with the following command:

```shell
git fetch --all
```

### Step 2: List All Branches

Once you have fetched all the remote branches, you can list all the branches with the following command:

```shell
git branch -a
```

This command will list all the local and remote branches.

### Step 3: Checkout Each Remote Branch

Once you have listed all the remote branches, you can checkout each branch with the following command:

```shell
git checkout [branch_name]
```

This will checkout the specified branch.

### Step 4: Push Branches to Local Repository

Once you have checked out all the remote branches, you can push them to your local repository with the following command:

```shell
git push origin [branch_name]
```

This will push the specified branch to your local repository.
