### No

It is not necessary to check in the `node_modules` folder to Git when creating a Node.js app on Heroku. This is because Heroku automatically installs the necessary dependencies for your application when you deploy it.

### Why Not

Checking in the `node_modules` folder to Git can lead to a bloated repository, as the folder can contain hundreds of files and take up a lot of space. It also increases the size of the repository, making it slower to clone and pull from.

### What to Do

Instead of checking in the `node_modules` folder to Git, it is better to include a `package.json` file in the root of your repository. This file will contain a list of the dependencies needed for your application, which Heroku will automatically install when you deploy your application.
