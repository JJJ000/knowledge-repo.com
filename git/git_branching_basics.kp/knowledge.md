tldr: Git branch creates a new branch from the current branch, fork creates a new repository from an existing repository, fetch retrieves new commits from a remote repository, merge combines two branches, rebase replays the commits of one branch onto another, and clone creates a local copy of a remote repository.

### Git Branch
Git branch is used to create a new branch of a repository. This allows a user to work on a different version of a repository, while keeping the master branch untouched.

### Fork
Forking is the process of creating a copy of a repository in your own account. This allows you to make changes to the repository without affecting the original.

### Fetch
Fetching is the process of downloading objects and references from a remote repository into a local repository. This allows the user to keep their local repository up to date with the remote repository.

### Merge
Merging is the process of combining two branches into one. This allows the user to take the changes from one branch and incorporate them into another branch.

### Rebase
Rebasing is the process of taking the changes from one branch and applying them to another branch. This allows the user to keep two branches in sync with each other.

### Clone
Cloning is the process of creating a local copy of a remote repository. This allows the user to work on the repository locally and then push the changes back to the remote repository.
