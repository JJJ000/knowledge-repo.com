[TOC]

### Version Control System
Mercurial and Git are both distributed version control systems. They both allow for the tracking of versions of files, as well as the ability to undo changes and revert back to earlier versions.

### Branching
Git's branching model is more flexible than Mercurial's. Git allows for multiple branches to be created and merged quickly, while Mercurial requires a more rigid approach to branching and merging.

### Workflow
Git's workflow is more streamlined than Mercurial's, as it allows for multiple developers to work on the same project without having to coordinate their changes. Mercurial is more focused on a centralized workflow, where all changes have to be coordinated before they can be merged.

### User Interface
Mercurial has a more intuitive user interface than Git, which can be intimidating for new users. Mercurial also provides more graphical tools for visualizing changes, while Git requires a more command-line oriented approach.
