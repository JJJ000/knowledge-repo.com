### Prerequisites
Before upgrading Git on Windows, make sure the following prerequisites are met:
- Git must be installed on the system.
- The latest version of the Windows Installer (MSI) must be downloaded from the [Git downloads page](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

### Uninstall Old Version
The old version of Git must be uninstalled before installing the new version. This can be done by going to the Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features and selecting the old version of Git. Select Uninstall and follow the instructions to complete the uninstallation process.

### Install New Version
Once the old version of Git is uninstalled, the new version can be installed. Run the MSI installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation.

### Verify Installation
Once the installation is complete, open a command line window and type `git --version` to verify that the new version has been installed.
