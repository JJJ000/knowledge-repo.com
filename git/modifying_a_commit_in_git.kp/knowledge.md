### Step 1: Amend the Commit

To modify a specific commit in Git, you can use the `git commit --amend` command. This command allows you to make changes to the most recent commit.

### Step 2: Add the Changes

Once you've amended the commit, you can add the changes you want to make. This can be done by adding the files to the staging area with `git add` and then using `git commit --amend` to commit the changes.

### Step 3: Push the Changes

Once the changes have been committed, you can push them to the remote repository with `git push -f`. This will overwrite the existing commit with the amended one.

### Step 4: Clean Up

If you want to keep your commit history clean, you can use `git rebase` to squash the amended commit into the previous commit. This will make it look like the changes were part of the original commit.
