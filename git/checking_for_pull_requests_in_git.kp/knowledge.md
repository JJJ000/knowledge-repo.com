### Check Local Repository

The first step to check if a pull is needed in Git is to check the local repository. This can be done by running the command `git status`. This will indicate if the local repository is up-to-date with the remote repository or if a pull is needed.

### Check Remote Repository

The next step is to check the remote repository. This can be done by running the command `git fetch origin`. This will fetch the latest changes from the remote repository and it will indicate if there are any changes that need to be pulled.

### Pull Changes

Once the remote repository has been checked, the next step is to pull the changes. This can be done by running the command `git pull origin`. This will pull the latest changes from the remote repository and it will update the local repository with the new changes.

### Push Changes

Finally, once the changes have been pulled from the remote repository, the changes need to be pushed to the remote repository. This can be done by running the command `git push origin`. This will push the changes to the remote repository and it will update the remote repository with the new changes.
