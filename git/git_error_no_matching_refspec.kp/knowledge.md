# Solution

## Overview
Git error `src refspec master does not match any` occurs when you try to push a branch to a remote repository that doesn't exist. This error is usually caused by a misconfigured repository or by an incorrect command syntax.

## Causes
The most common cause of this error is when you try to push a local branch to a remote repository that does not exist. This can happen if you have not configured the remote repository correctly, or if you have typed the command incorrectly.

Another cause can be if you are trying to push a branch to a remote repository that has already been deleted.

## Solutions
The best way to resolve this error is to ensure that the remote repository is correctly configured and that the command syntax is correct.

If the remote repository has been deleted, you will need to create a new repository and push your branch to it.

If the remote repository exists but you are still getting the error, you may need to use the `--force` flag when pushing the branch. This will overwrite any existing changes in the remote repository.
