### Step 1: Create a .gitignore File

The first step is to create a `.gitignore` file in the root of your project. This file will tell Git which files and folders to ignore when committing changes.

### Step 2: Add node_modules to .gitignore

Once the `.gitignore` file has been created, you can add `node_modules` to the list of files and folders that should be ignored. This will ensure that any changes to the `node_modules` folder will not be committed to the repository.

### Step 3: Commit the .gitignore File

Once the `.gitignore` file has been created and populated with the desired entries, you can commit the file to the repository. This will ensure that the `.gitignore` file will be applied to all future commits.

### Step 4: Push the Changes

Finally, you can push the changes to your remote repository. This will ensure that the `.gitignore` file is applied to any future commits from any contributors to your project.
