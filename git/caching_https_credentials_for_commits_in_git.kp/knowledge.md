### Caching HTTPS Credentials

HTTPS credentials can be cached in order to facilitate pushing commits in Git. This can be done using a credential helper, which is a program that stores and retrieves credentials from a secure store.

### Configuring the Credential Helper

To configure the credential helper, the user must first install the helper on their system. After installation, the user must then configure the helper by running the following command:

```git
git config --global credential.helper <helper-name>
```

Where `<helper-name>` is the name of the credential helper to be used.

### Using the Credential Helper

Once the credential helper is configured, it can be used to store and retrieve credentials. When pushing a commit, the user will be prompted to enter their credentials. The credential helper will then store the credentials in a secure store.

The next time the user pushes a commit, the credential helper will retrieve the stored credentials and automatically authenticate the user. This eliminates the need for the user to manually enter their credentials each time they push a commit.

### Conclusion

Caching HTTPS credentials can be a useful way to facilitate pushing commits in Git. By configuring and using a credential helper, the user can securely store and retrieve their credentials, eliminating the need to manually enter them each time they push a commit.
