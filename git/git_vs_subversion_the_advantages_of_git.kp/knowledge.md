tldr: Git is better than Subversion because it is a distributed version control system that allows for faster, more efficient collaboration.

[TOC]

1. **Speed:** 
Git is much faster than Subversion. This is because Git stores data in a local database and only sends the difference between the local and remote repositories when syncing. Subversion, on the other hand, stores data in a central repository and must send the entire file or repository each time a change is made.

2. **Branching:**
Git's branching capabilities are much more powerful than Subversion's. Git branches are very lightweight and can be created and merged quickly and easily. Subversion branches are heavier and more cumbersome to manage.

3. **Distributed Version Control:**
Git is a distributed version control system, meaning that it allows multiple developers to work on the same project from different locations. Subversion is a centralized version control system, meaning that it requires all developers to be connected to the same central repository.

4. **Security:**
Git is more secure than Subversion. Git's data integrity is ensured through the use of cryptographic hashes, while Subversion relies on file locks and server-side hooks to prevent data corruption.
