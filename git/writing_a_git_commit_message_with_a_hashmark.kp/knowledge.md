### Commit Message Guidelines
### Format
A commit message should always start with a hashmark (#) followed by a brief description of the changes made in the commit.

### Content
The commit message should explain what changes were made, why they were made, and any other pertinent information. It should be written in the imperative mood, as if giving an instruction to the codebase.

### Length
Commit messages should be succinct and to the point. They should be no more than 50 characters long.
