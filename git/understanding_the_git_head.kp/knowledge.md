#What is the HEAD in Git?

##Definition
The HEAD in Git is a reference to the branch or commit that is currently checked out in a local working copy. It is a pointer that holds the reference to the last commit that was checked out.

##Purpose
The purpose of the HEAD is to allow the user to easily switch between different branches and commits. It keeps track of the last commit that was checked out and allows the user to quickly and easily switch to a different commit or branch.

##Usage
The HEAD can be used to switch between branches and commits. To switch to a different branch or commit, the user can use the `git checkout` command followed by the branch or commit name. This will switch the HEAD to the specified branch or commit.
