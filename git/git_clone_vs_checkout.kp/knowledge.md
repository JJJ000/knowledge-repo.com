### Git Clone
Git clone is a command used to create a local copy of a remote repository. It copies the entire repository including all the branches, commits, and tags.

### Git Checkout
Git checkout is a command used to switch between different branches in a repository. It allows the user to switch between different versions of the repository and view the differences between them. It does not clone the repository, but instead creates a reference to the current branch.
