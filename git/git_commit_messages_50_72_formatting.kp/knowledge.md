[TOC]

### Title

The title should be a short, descriptive phrase that summarizes the changes made in the commit. It should be no longer than 50 characters, and should not end with a period.

### Body

The body should provide a detailed explanation of the changes made in the commit. It should include why the changes were made, what was changed, and any other relevant information. It should be wrapped at 72 characters, and should not end with a period.

### Footer

The footer should include any relevant information that doesn't fit in the title or body. This could include references to related issues, a link to the original commit, or an explanation of why the commit was necessary.

### Formatting

When writing a commit message, it is important to follow the 50/72 formatting guidelines. This means that the title should be no longer than 50 characters, and the body should be wrapped at 72 characters. Additionally, both the title and body should not end with a period.
