### Git Stash
Git Stash is a command line tool used to save changes that are not yet committed to a local repository. It is used to temporarily store changes that are not ready to be committed, but need to be saved for later use. It is a convenient way to store changes in a safe place while you switch branches or perform other tasks.

### Shelve in IntelliJ IDEA
Shelve in IntelliJ IDEA is a feature that allows users to save their changes to a local repository without committing them. It is similar to Git Stash in that it allows users to store changes in a safe place for later use, but it differs in that it does not require the use of the command line. Shelve also allows users to quickly switch between different versions of their code without having to commit each change.
