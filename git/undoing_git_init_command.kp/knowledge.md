Git init is a command used to initialize a new Git repository. It creates an empty Git repository or re-initializes an existing one. When you run the command, a .git directory is created in the current working directory, which contains all the necessary metadata for the repo.

Undoing Git Init
----------------
Since there is no command to undo git init, you must manually delete the .git directory that was created when you ran git init. This can be done either by using the command line or by using a file manager.

Conclusion
