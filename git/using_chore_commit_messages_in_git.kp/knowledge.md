### When to Use "Chore"

### Definition
The term "chore" is used in Git to refer to a commit that is not related to a feature or bugfix. Chore commits are typically used to make changes to a project's infrastructure, such as updating dependencies, refactoring code, or improving the project's build process. 

### Benefits
Using chore commits helps to keep the project's commit history organized and easy to navigate. It also makes it easier to identify which commits are related to features or bugfixes, and which ones are related to project infrastructure.

### Examples
Some examples of changes that would be considered chore commits include:
- Updating a dependency
- Refactoring code
- Improving the project's build process
- Adding a new linter
- Adding a new test suite

### Conclusion
Using chore commits in Git can help to keep the project's commit history organized and easy to navigate. It is a good practice to use chore commits for any changes related to the project's infrastructure.
