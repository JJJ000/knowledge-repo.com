### Naming Repositories

When creating a repository, it is important to choose a name that clearly communicates the purpose of the repository. This will help others find and understand the purpose of the repository quickly. 

### Formatting Repository Names

Repository names should be written in lowercase and should use hyphens to separate words. For example, a repository for a project called "My Awesome Project" should be named my-awesome-project.

### Avoiding Unclear Names

Avoid names that are too general or vague. For example, a repository called "Project" is not descriptive enough to be meaningful.

### Using Descriptive Names

When possible, use descriptive names that clearly communicate the purpose of the repository. For example, a repository for an online store could be called "online-store".
