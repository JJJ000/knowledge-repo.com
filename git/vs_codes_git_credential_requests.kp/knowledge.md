### What are Git Credentials?
Git credentials are the usernames and passwords that are used to authenticate users when they access a Git repository.

### Why is Visual Studio Code Asking for Git Credentials?
Visual Studio Code is asking for Git credentials because it needs to authenticate the user in order to access the Git repository. Without valid credentials, Visual Studio Code will not be able to access the repository.

### How to Provide Git Credentials to Visual Studio Code?

1. By entering the credentials directly into Visual Studio Code.
2. By configuring an authentication method such as SSH key, OAuth token, or Personal Access Token.
