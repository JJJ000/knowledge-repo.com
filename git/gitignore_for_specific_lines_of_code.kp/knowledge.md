tldr: Git does not support ignoring individual lines of code; however, you can use a pre-commit hook to reject commits containing specific lines.

# Section 1 - Create a .gitignore File

The first step to ignore individual lines of code is to create a `.gitignore` file in the root of your project directory. This file will contain all the patterns you want Git to ignore when it is tracking changes to your code.

# Section 2 - Add Patterns to .gitignore

Once you have created the `.gitignore` file, you can add patterns to it that will tell Git to ignore certain lines of code. For example, if you want to ignore all lines of code that contain the word `password`, you can add the following pattern to the `.gitignore` file:

```
*password*
```

# Section 3 - Commit and Push

After you have added the patterns you want to ignore to the `.gitignore` file, you can commit and push the changes to your remote repository. This will ensure that the `.gitignore` file is tracked by Git and that the patterns you have added will be applied when tracking changes in the future.

# Section 4 - Verify

Finally, you can verify that the patterns you added to the `.gitignore` file are being applied correctly by running a `git status` command. This will show you which files are being tracked and which files are being ignored. If the patterns you added are being applied correctly, the files containing the lines of code you want to ignore should not be listed as modified or untracked.
