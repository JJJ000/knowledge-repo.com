1. **Navigate to the Desired Directory**

Begin by opening Git Bash, then navigate to the directory you want to change to. To do this, type in the command `cd <directory path>` and press Enter. For example, if you want to go to the Documents folder, type in `cd Documents` and press Enter.

2. **Check the Current Directory**

Once you have navigated to the desired directory, you can check that you are in the correct place by typing in the command `pwd` and pressing Enter. This will output the full filepath of the directory you are currently in.

3. **Create a New Directory**

If you want to create a new directory in the current directory, type in the command `mkDIR <directory name>` and press Enter. For example, if you want to create a new folder called “MyFolder”, type in `MKDIR MyFolder` and press Enter.

4. **Change the Current Directory**

Once you have created the new directory, you can change the current directory to the new directory you just created. To do this, type in the command `cd <directory name>` and press Enter. For example, if you want to change to the “MyFolder” directory, type in `cd MyFolder` and press Enter.
