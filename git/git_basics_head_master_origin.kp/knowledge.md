# HEAD
HEAD is a pointer in git that points to the most recent commit in the current branch. It is the default branch when you first clone a repository.

# Master
The master branch is the default branch in git. It is the main branch of a repository and is used to track all the changes made to the repository.

# Origin
Origin is the remote repository that is cloned when you first create a local repository. It is the default remote repository for your local repository and is used to push and pull changes from the remote repository.
