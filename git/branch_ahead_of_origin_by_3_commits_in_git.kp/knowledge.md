### What Does Ahead of Origin/Master Mean?
Ahead of origin/master means that the branch is more up-to-date than the master branch. This means that the branch has more commits than the master branch.

### What Does 3 Commits Mean?
When a branch is ahead of origin/master by 3 commits, it means that the branch has 3 more commits than the master branch. This means that 3 new changes have been made to the branch that have not been added to the master branch yet.

### How to Check Ahead of Origin/Master
To check if a branch is ahead of origin/master, you can use the `git status` command. This command will show you the number of commits that have been made to the branch that have not been added to the master branch yet.

### How to Push Commits to Origin/Master
To push the commits to origin/master, you can use the `git push` command. This command will push the commits to the master branch and make them available for everyone to use.
