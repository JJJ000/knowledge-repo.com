**Contents**

[TOC]

1. When Feature is Complete and Merged 
When a feature branch is no longer needed, it should be deleted. This should happen after the feature branch has been merged into the main branch (usually master or develop). 

2. When Branches are Outdated 
Branches should also be deleted when they are no longer relevant or up-to-date. This includes branches that are no longer needed, or branches that have become stale due to lack of activity. 

3. When Branches are Unused 
If a branch is no longer in use, it should be deleted to avoid clutter and confusion. This includes branches that were created for testing purposes or to experiment with a new feature, but were never merged or used in any meaningful way. 

4. When Branches are Unnecessary 
If a branch is no longer necessary, it should be deleted. This includes branches that were created for a specific purpose but are no longer needed, or branches that duplicate existing functionality.
