### Working on Two Branches at Once

Git allows developers to work on two branches at the same time. This can be useful when working on long-term development projects and when needing to perform bug fixes and other maintenance tasks.

### Switching Between Branches

Git makes it easy to switch between branches. All you need to do is run the `git checkout` command followed by the name of the branch you want to switch to. This will switch your working directory to the branch you specified.

### Merging Branches

When you're done working on a branch, you can merge it back into the main branch. To do this, you'll need to use the `git merge` command followed by the name of the branch you want to merge. This will combine the changes from the two branches into one.

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

Sometimes when merging two branches, you may encounter merge conflicts. These occur when two branches have conflicting changes. To resolve them, you'll need to manually edit the affected files and resolve the conflicts. Once you're done, you can commit the changes and the merge will be complete.
