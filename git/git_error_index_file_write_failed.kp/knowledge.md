# Solution 1:
1. Check if there is enough disk space available on the drive where the repository is located.
2. Make sure that the user running the command has read/write permissions to the repository.

# Solution 2:
1. Check if the index file is write-protected.
2. Try running the command with the `--no-replace-objects` flag to prevent any existing index files from being overwritten.
3. If the problem persists, try deleting the index file and running the command again.
