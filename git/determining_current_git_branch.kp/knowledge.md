### Section 1 - Prerequisites

Before attempting to programmatically determine the current checked out Git branch, the following must be in place:

1. Git must be installed on the system.
2. The repository must have been cloned.

### Section 2 - Using Git Bash

If Git Bash is available, the following command can be used to programmatically determine the current checked out Git branch:

```git
$ git branch
```

The output of this command will list all the branches in the repository, with the current checked out branch being prefixed with an asterisk.

### Section 3 - Using the Git API

The Git API can also be used to programmatically determine the current checked out Git branch. The `git_branch_current` function can be used to return the name of the current branch.

### Section 4 - Using Third-Party Libraries

Third-party libraries such as LibGit2 can also be used to programmatically determine the current checked out Git branch. LibGit2 provides an API for accessing the Git repository, which can be used to retrieve the current branch.
