### Yes
1. If the unlink of the file failed, it is recommended to try again in Git.
2. This is because Git is designed to be resilient to errors and can be used to correct mistakes.
3. To try again in Git, you can use the `git reset` command to reset the repository to the last known good state.
4. Additionally, you can use the `git checkout` command to restore the file to the previous version before the unlink failed.

### No
1. If the unlink of the file failed, it is not recommended to try again in Git.
2. This is because the file may have already been corrupted or lost and attempting to use Git to restore it may cause further damage.
3. Instead, it is advisable to restore the file from a backup or to recreate it from scratch.
4. Additionally, it is important to identify the cause of the unlink failure and take steps to prevent it from happening again.
