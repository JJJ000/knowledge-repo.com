# Section 1: Check for Unstaged Changes
1. In the terminal, navigate to the directory of the branch.
2. Type `git status` and press enter.
3. If the output of `git status` shows "nothing to commit, working tree clean," then there are no unstaged changes.

# Section 2: Check for Staged Changes
1. Type `git diff --staged` and press enter.
2. If the output of `git diff --staged` shows "no changes added to commit," then there are no staged changes.

# Section 3: Check for Uncommitted Changes
1. Type `git log` and press enter.
2. If the output of `git log` shows "nothing to commit, working tree clean," then there are no uncommitted changes.

# Section 4: Check for Unpushed Changes
1. Type `git log origin/<branch-name>` and press enter.
2. Compare the output of `git log origin/<branch-name>` to `git log`.
3. If the two outputs are the same, then there are no unpushed changes.
