### Check SSH Keys

The first step in solving a Permission denied (publickey) error when using Git is to check the SSH keys associated with the project. It is possible that the wrong key is being used, or that the key is not properly associated with the project.

### Check Remote URL

The second step is to check the remote URL associated with the project. It is possible that the wrong URL is being used, or that the URL is not properly formatted. 

### Troubleshoot SSH Agent

The third step is to troubleshoot the SSH agent that is being used to connect to the remote repository. It is possible that the SSH agent is not properly configured or that the correct SSH key is not being used.

### Check Firewall Settings

The fourth step is to check the firewall settings associated with the project. It is possible that the firewall is blocking the connection to the remote repository. If this is the case, it will need to be adjusted in order to allow the connection.
