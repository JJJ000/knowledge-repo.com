1. **Set Up Search Tool**

First, you will need to set up a search tool to search for the string across all branches. You can use a tool such as `git grep` or `git log --grep` to search for the string.

2. **Checkout All Branches**

Next, you will need to checkout all of the branches you want to search through. You can do this by running `git branch -a` to list all branches and then `git checkout <branch_name>` for each branch you want to search.

3. **Run Search Command**

Once you have all of the branches checked out, you can run the search command you set up in step 1. For example, if you are using `git grep`, you can run `git grep <string>`.

4. **View Results**

Finally, you can view the results of the search. Depending on the search tool you used, the results may be displayed in the terminal or you may need to view them in a text editor.
