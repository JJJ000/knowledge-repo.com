### Troubleshooting

1. Check your internet connection:
The first step should be to check your internet connection. If it is not connecting, then the error message you receive is expected.

2. Check your firewall settings:
If you are connected to a corporate network, you may need to check your firewall settings. Some organizations block access to GitHub and other remote repositories.

3. Check your Git configuration:
If you have recently changed your Git configuration, it could be the reason why you are receiving this error. Make sure you have the correct remote repository URL in your configuration.

4. Try a different network:
If all else fails, try connecting to a different network. This could be a public Wi-Fi or a mobile data connection. This will help you narrow down the source of the issue.
