### What is git export?
Git export is an operation that is used to create an archive of a repository at a certain point in time. It is similar to the "svn export" command in Subversion, which creates a clean copy of a repository without any of the version control metadata.

### How does it work?
Git export works by creating a snapshot of the repository at the specified commit. This snapshot is then compressed into an archive file, which can be downloaded or moved to another location. The archive contains all of the files in the repository at the specified commit, but does not include any of the version control metadata (such as commit messages, branches, etc).

### What are the benefits?
The main benefit of using git export is that it allows you to create a clean copy of a repository at a certain point in time. This can be useful if you need to create a snapshot of a codebase for archiving purposes, or if you need to transfer a repository to another system without any of the version control metadata.

### What are the drawbacks?
The main drawback of using git export is that it does not include any of the version control metadata, such as commit messages, branches, etc. This means that if you need to transfer a repository to another system and preserve the version control history, then git export is not the best option.
