## Local
The local version of the git file will be used by default. This version is stored on the user's local machine and is the version that the user has most recently saved.

## Base
The base version of the git file is the version that was originally created. This version is stored on the server and is the version that the user should use as a reference when making changes.

## Remote
The remote version of the git file is the version that is stored on the remote server. This version is the most up-to-date version of the git file and is the version that other users will see when they access the file.

## Final Version
The final version of the git file will be the one that is most up-to-date. This version will be the one that is stored on the remote server and is the version that all users should use when making changes to the file.
