### Definition
Bump Version (BV) is a command-line tool used in Git to increment the version number of a project. It is used to make sure that the version of a project is up-to-date and accurately reflects the current state of the project.

### Usage
BV is typically used to increment the version number of a project in the following scenarios:
- When a new feature is added to the project
- When a bug is fixed
- When a new release of the project is made

### Benefits
Using BV ensures that the version of a project is always up-to-date and accurately reflects the current state of the project. This makes it easier for users to keep track of the project's development and to determine which version of the project they should be using.

### Limitations
BV does not provide any functionality beyond incrementing the version number of a project. It does not provide any other information about the project, such as the changes that have been made since the last version. For this, other tools must be used.
