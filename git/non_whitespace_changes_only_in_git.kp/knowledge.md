### Introduction

Git is a version control system used to track changes in computer files and coordinate work on those files among multiple people. It is most commonly used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.

### Non-Whitespace Changes

Non-whitespace changes are changes to the content of a file, such as adding or removing lines of text, changing the order of lines, or changing the meaning of phrases. These changes are tracked by Git and can be used to track the evolution of a project.

### Tracking Non-Whitespace Changes

Git can be used to track non-whitespace changes by taking snapshots of the repository at different points in time. When a change is made, Git stores the difference between the old version and the new version. This allows users to go back in time and see the changes that have been made.

### Conclusion

Git is a powerful tool for tracking non-whitespace changes in files. By taking snapshots of the repository at different points in time, users can easily track the evolution of a project and go back in time to see the changes that have been made.
