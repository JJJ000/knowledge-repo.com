### Step 1: Create the Pull Request

The first step is to create the pull request. This can be done by navigating to the repository's main page, clicking the "New Pull Request" button, and then selecting the branch you want to merge.

### Step 2: Link the Pull Request to the Issue

Once the pull request has been created, you can link it to the existing issue by typing the issue number in the description box of the pull request. This will automatically link the pull request to the issue.

### Step 3: Add Labels

Once the pull request is linked to the issue, you can add labels to it. This can be done by clicking the "Labels" tab on the pull request page and then selecting the labels you want to add.

### Step 4: Submit the Pull Request

Once the labels have been added, you can submit the pull request by clicking the "Create pull request" button. This will create the pull request and link it to the existing issue.
