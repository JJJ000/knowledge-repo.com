### Explanation

Git pull is a command used to download content from a remote repository. Therefore, it cannot be used while not in a git directory. Git directories are directories that have been initialized with the `git init` command.

### Alternative

If you are not in a git directory, you can use the `git clone` command to download content from a remote repository. This command will create a new git directory in the current working directory.

### Usage

The syntax for the `git clone` command is:

```
git clone <repository_url>
```

### Example

For example, to clone the repository at `https://github.com/user/my-repo`, you would run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/user/my-repo
```
