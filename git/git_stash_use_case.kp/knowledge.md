### Storing Uncommitted Changes

Git stash is a command that allows users to temporarily store uncommitted changes in a local repository. This allows users to switch between different branches without having to commit changes that are not ready to be shared.

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

Git stash also allows users to save changes while resolving merge conflicts. This allows users to save their work while they are resolving the conflicts, and then reapply the changes once the conflict is resolved.

### Reverting Changes

Git stash can also be used to quickly revert changes that have been made to a repository. This is useful for undoing accidental changes or for testing out different ideas without having to commit them.

### Reorganizing Code

Finally, Git stash can be used to reorganize code without having to commit the changes. This is useful when refactoring code or reorganizing files, as it allows users to quickly test out changes without having to commit them to the repository.
