# Introduction

Git is a version control system designed to help developers keep track of changes to their code. It can also be used to track file copy operations, allowing developers to easily view the history of file copies and roll back to previous versions if needed.

# Setup

Before you can begin tracking file copy operations with Git, you'll need to set up a repository. This involves creating a directory for the repository, initializing it with Git, and adding the files you want to track.

# Tracking File Copies

Once your repository is set up, you can begin tracking file copy operations with Git. To do this, you'll need to use the git add command to add the files to the repository. This will add the files to the staging area, where they can be tracked by Git.

# Rolling Back Changes

If you ever need to roll back to a previous version of a file, you can use the git checkout command to do so. This will revert the file to the version that was previously stored in the repository.

You can also use the git log command to view the history of file copies. This will show you the list of commits that have been made to the repository, allowing you to easily find the version you need to revert to.
