#### Number of Files

Git does not have a hard limit on the number of files that can be stored in a repository. However, it is important to keep in mind that the larger the repository, the slower the performance.

#### File Size

Git has a file size limit of 100MB. This limit applies to individual files and not to the total repository size.

#### File Path Length

Git has a file path length limit of 4096 characters. This limit applies to individual file paths and not to the total repository size.

#### File Name Length

Git has a file name length limit of 255 characters. This limit applies to individual file names and not to the total repository size.
