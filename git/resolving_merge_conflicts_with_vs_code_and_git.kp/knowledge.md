# Step 1: Identify the Conflicts

When working on a project with Git, it is possible for different users to make changes to the same file at the same time. When these changes are committed, a conflict may arise. To identify these conflicts, you can use the `git status` command. This will show any files that have conflicting changes.

# Step 2: View the Conflicts

Once the conflicts are identified, you can view them by opening the file in question. The conflicts will be marked with special symbols, such as `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`. This will allow you to see which changes are conflicting and which changes are being kept.

# Step 3: Resolve the Conflicts

Once the conflicts are identified, you can resolve them by manually editing the file. You can either choose to keep one of the changes, or you can combine the changes to form a new solution. Once you have resolved the conflicts, you can save the file and commit the changes.

# Step 4: Push the Changes

Once the conflicts have been resolved, you can push the changes by using the `git push` command. This will push the changes to the remote repository, and the conflicts will be resolved.
