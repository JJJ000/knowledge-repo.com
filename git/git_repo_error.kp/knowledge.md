### Introduction

Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history are mirrored on every developer's system. When a developer makes a change, they can push it to the remote repository for other developers to access.

### What is a Git Repository?

A Git repository is a directory where files are stored and tracked by the version control system. It contains the entire history of all the files in the project, including every version of every file. A repository can be either local or remote, depending on where it is stored. A local repository is stored on the developer's machine, while a remote repository is stored on a server, such as GitHub.

### Not a Git Repository Error

When a user tries to access a directory that is not a Git repository, they will receive the error message "fatal: Not a git repository (or any of the parent directories): .git". This error occurs because the directory does not contain a .git folder, which is necessary for a Git repository.

### Resolution

In order to solve this issue, the user needs to create a Git repository in the directory by running the "git init" command. This will create a .git folder in the directory and initialize the repository. The user can then add files to the repository and start tracking changes.
