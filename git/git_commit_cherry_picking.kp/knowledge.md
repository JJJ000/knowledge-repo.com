### Definition
Cherry-picking a commit with Git means selecting a specific commit from a branch and applying it to a different branch. This allows the user to pick and choose the specific changes they want to add to the new branch, instead of having to merge the entire branch.

### Process
The process of cherry-picking a commit with Git involves using the `git cherry-pick` command. This command takes the commit hash of the commit that you want to cherry-pick and applies it to the current branch. This allows you to select the specific changes you want to apply, instead of having to merge the entire branch.

### Benefits
Cherry-picking a commit with Git has several benefits. It allows you to quickly and easily pick and choose the specific changes you want to add to a branch, instead of having to merge the entire branch. It also allows you to quickly add bug fixes or features to a branch without having to merge the entire branch. Finally, it allows you to easily trace the changes that have been applied to a branch, as the commit hashes are stored in the commit history.
