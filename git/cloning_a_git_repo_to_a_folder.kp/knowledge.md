### Step 1: Find the URL of the Repository

The first step to cloning a Git repository is to find the URL of the repository. This can be found on the main page of the repository, usually near the top.

### Step 2: Open the Command Line

The next step is to open the command line. This can be done by searching for "Command Prompt" or "Terminal" in the start menu.

### Step 3: Use the Git Clone Command

Once the command line is open, use the `git clone` command to clone the repository. The command should look something like this:

```shell
git clone [repository URL] [target folder]
```

The repository URL should be replaced with the URL of the repository, and the target folder should be replaced with the path of the folder you want to clone the repository into.

### Step 4: Verify the Clone

The last step is to verify that the repository was successfully cloned. To do this, navigate to the target folder and list the contents. If the repository was successfully cloned, the contents of the repository should be listed.
