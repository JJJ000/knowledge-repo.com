#Origin
Origin is a local repository on your computer that is connected to the remote repository on GitHub. It is a pointer to the remote repository and helps you to keep track of the changes that have been made in the remote repository.

#Upstream
Upstream is a remote repository on GitHub that is connected to the local repository on your computer. It is used to keep track of changes that have been made in the remote repository and to fetch updates from the remote repository.
