### Authentication

Github is asking for a username and password when pushing a new repository because it needs to authenticate the user. Authentication is the process of verifying that the user is who they say they are, and it is necessary for any secure system.

### Authorization

After authentication, Github also needs to authorize the user to perform certain actions. Authorization is the process of determining whether the user has the necessary permissions to perform a certain action. In this case, the user needs to be authorized to push the repository, and the username and password are used to verify that the user has the necessary permissions.

### Security

Authentication and authorization are important security measures that help to protect Github from unauthorized access. Without authentication and authorization, anyone could push a repository without permission, which could potentially lead to data breaches or other security issues. 

### Convenience

In addition to providing security, the username and password also make it more convenient for users to access their repositories. By requiring the user to authenticate themselves, Github can ensure that the user is the one who is pushing the repository and that they have the necessary permissions to do so.
