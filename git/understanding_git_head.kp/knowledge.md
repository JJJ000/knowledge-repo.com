### What is HEAD in Git?

### Definition
HEAD is a pointer in Git that points to the most recent commit in the current branch. It is the default branch that is checked out when you clone a repository.

### Benefits
Using HEAD allows developers to quickly access the most recent commit in their repository. It also provides a convenient way to switch between branches and to reset the repository.
