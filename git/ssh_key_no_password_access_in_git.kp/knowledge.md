### Introduction
SSH keys provide a secure way to authenticate with a remote server without needing to enter a password. SSH keys are generated using a public/private key pair and stored on the client machine. The public key is shared with the remote server, while the private key is kept secret. When the client attempts to connect to the remote server, the public key is used to authenticate the client's identity.

### Why is a Password/Passphrase Still Requested?
Despite the use of SSH keys, it is still possible for a user to be asked for a password or passphrase when attempting to connect to a remote server. This is because SSH keys are not the only form of authentication that can be used. Some remote servers may also require additional authentication methods, such as passwords or passphrases. 

### How to Avoid Asking for Password/Passphrase
If a user does not wish to be asked for a password or passphrase when connecting to a remote server, the best way to avoid this is to ensure that the SSH key is properly configured. This means that the public key must be correctly installed on the remote server, and the private key must be securely stored on the client machine. Additionally, the user should ensure that their SSH key is properly configured for their specific remote server. 

### Conclusion
In conclusion, SSH keys provide a secure way to authenticate with a remote server without needing to enter a password. However, it is still possible for a user to be asked for a password or passphrase when attempting to connect to a remote server. To avoid this, the user should ensure that their SSH key is properly configured for their specific remote server.
