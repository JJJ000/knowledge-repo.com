###### Visual Diff in SourceTree

SourceTree is a graphical user interface for Git that includes a visual diff tool. This tool allows users to compare the differences between two branches, commits, or files. The diff tool is available in the ‘Diff’ tab, which is located in the bottom-right corner of the SourceTree window. 

###### Comparing Branches

To compare two branches, first select the branch you want to compare from the ‘Branches’ tab. Then, select the ‘Diff’ tab and click the ‘Compare’ button. In the ‘Compare’ window, select the branch you want to compare to. This will open the visual diff between the two branches. 

###### Comparing Commits

To compare two commits, select the commit you want to compare from the ‘Commits’ tab. Then, select the ‘Diff’ tab and click the ‘Compare’ button. In the ‘Compare’ window, select the commit you want to compare to. This will open the visual diff between the two commits. 

###### Comparing Files

To compare two files, select the file you want to compare from the ‘Files’ tab. Then, select the ‘Diff’ tab and click the ‘Compare’ button. In the ‘Compare’ window, select the file you want to compare to. This will open the visual diff between the two files.
