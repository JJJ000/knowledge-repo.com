### Introduction

Git has removed support for password authentication and now requires users to use a personal access token instead. This article will explain why this change was made and how to use a personal access token. 

### Reasons for Change

Password authentication was removed for several reasons. First, passwords are vulnerable to brute-force attacks, which can easily compromise user accounts. Second, passwords are not as secure as personal access tokens, which are much harder to guess. Finally, passwords are not as convenient as personal access tokens, which can be easily revoked or changed.

### Using Personal Access Tokens

Using a personal access token is easy. First, you will need to generate a token in your Git account settings. Then, you will need to copy the token and paste it into the authentication field when you log in. Finally, you will need to save the token in a secure location so that you can use it again in the future.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, Git has removed support for password authentication and now requires users to use a personal access token instead. This change was made for security and convenience reasons, and it is easy to use a personal access token.
