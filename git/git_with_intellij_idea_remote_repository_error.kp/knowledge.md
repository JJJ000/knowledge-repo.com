### Step 1: Check Git Configuration

Check your Git configuration to make sure that the repository URL is correctly configured. You can do this by running the following command:

```git
git config --list
```

If the repository URL is not correctly configured, you will need to update it in the configuration file.

### Step 2: Check SSH Key

Make sure that your SSH key is correctly configured and added to the remote repository. You can do this by running the following command:

```git
ssh -T git@github.com
```

If the command fails, you will need to generate a new SSH key and add it to the remote repository.

### Step 3: Check Firewall Settings

Check your firewall settings to make sure that it is not blocking the connection to the remote repository. You can do this by temporarily disabling the firewall and trying to connect again.

### Step 4: Contact Your System Administrator

If the above steps do not resolve the issue, contact your system administrator for assistance.
