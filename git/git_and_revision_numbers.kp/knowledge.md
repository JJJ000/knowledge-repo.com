##Commit Hash
Git uses commit hashes rather than revision numbers. A commit hash is a unique identifier for a specific commit, and is a 40-character hexadecimal string. This string is generated by a cryptographic hash function, and is used to identify a particular commit in the repository's history.

##Branch
A branch is a pointer to a specific commit in the repository's history. A branch can be used to represent a certain version of the codebase, and can be used to track changes over time.

##Tag
A tag is a label that can be applied to a specific commit in the repository's history. Tags are typically used to mark specific versions of the codebase, such as a release version or a milestone.

##Reference
A reference is a pointer to a specific commit, branch, or tag in the repository's history. References can be used to refer to a specific commit, branch, or tag, and can be used to track changes over time.
