1. Using `git branch`

The easiest way to find out if a local git branch exists is to use the `git branch` command. This command will list out all the local branches in the repository, and you can easily scan through the list to see if the branch you're looking for exists.

2. Using `git show-ref`

Another way to find out if a local git branch exists is to use the `git show-ref` command. This command will list out all the references in the repository, including branches, tags, and commits. You can then search through the list to see if the branch you're looking for exists.

3. Using `git rev-parse`

Yet another way to find out if a local git branch exists is to use the `git rev-parse` command. This command will parse out the branch name from a given reference, and you can then use the parsed out branch name to see if the branch exists in the repository.

4. Using `git ls-remote`

Finally, you can also use the `git ls-remote` command to find out if a local git branch exists. This command will list out all the remote branches in the repository, and you can then search through the list to see if the branch you're looking for exists.
