### Git Cherry-pick
Git cherry-pick is a command that allows you to pick a commit from one branch and apply it to another. It is a useful tool for applying commits from one branch to another without having to merge the entire branch. This allows you to selectively apply changes from one branch to another without having to merge the entire branch.

### Merge Workflow
Merge workflow is a process that allows you to combine multiple branches into one. This is done by merging the changes from one branch into another, and then merging the resulting branch into the main branch. This process allows you to keep track of changes and ensure that the main branch is always up to date with the latest changes.

### Differences
The main difference between git cherry-pick and merge workflow is that cherry-pick allows you to selectively apply changes from one branch to another, while merge workflow combines multiple branches into one. Cherry-pick is useful for quickly applying changes from one branch to another, while merge workflow is more useful for keeping track of changes and ensuring that the main branch is always up to date with the latest changes.
