# Creating an Empty Branch on GitHub

## Step 1: Navigate to the Repository

To create an empty branch on GitHub, you must first navigate to the repository where the branch will be created. You can do this by clicking on the repository name in the left-hand sidebar of the GitHub homepage.

## Step 2: Create a New Branch

Once you are in the repository, click on the "Branch" drop-down menu in the upper-right corner of the page. This will open a dialogue box where you can enter the name of the new branch. Enter a descriptive name for the branch and click "Create branch" to create the branch.

## Step 3: Make a Commit

The new branch will be created, but it will still be empty. To make it a functional branch, you must make a commit. To do this, click the "Commit changes" button in the upper-right corner of the page. This will open a dialogue box where you can enter a commit message. Enter a descriptive message and click "Commit changes" to make the commit.

## Step 4: Push the Branch to GitHub

The new branch is now created and has a commit, but it is still only on your local machine. To make it available on GitHub, you must push the branch to GitHub. To do this, click the "Push" button in the upper-right corner of the page. This will push the branch to GitHub, making it available for others to use.
