# Tag
A tag is a lightweight object that points to a specific commit in the repository. It is used to mark a particular version of a project, and can be used to refer back to that version in the future.

# Release
A release is a tag that is used to indicate a version of the project that is ready to be released to the public. It typically includes additional information, such as release notes, that is not included in a regular tag. It is also used to mark the point at which the project is considered to be stable and ready for public use.
