### Introduction

Pull requests are a way to contribute code to a project on GitHub. They allow developers to make changes to a project and then submit those changes to the project maintainers for review and potential inclusion. Pull requests can be made for any commit, including the latest commit. This article will explain how to send a pull request on GitHub for only the latest commit.

### Steps

1. Log into your GitHub account and navigate to the project you want to contribute to.

2. Click on the “Pull requests” tab and then click “New pull request”.

3. On the “New pull request” page, select the branch that contains the latest commit.

4. Select the “Compare” button.

5. On the “Comparing changes” page, select the “Create pull request” button.

6. On the “Open a pull request” page, enter a title and description for your pull request and then click “Create pull request”.

### Conclusion

Sending a pull request on GitHub for only the latest commit is a straightforward process. All you need to do is log into your GitHub account, select the branch that contains the latest commit, and then create a pull request. Once the pull request is created, the maintainers of the project will review the changes and decide whether or not to include them.
