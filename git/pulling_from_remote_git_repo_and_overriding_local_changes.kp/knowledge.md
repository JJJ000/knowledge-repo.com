# Step 1: Pull from Remote Repository

To pull from a remote repository, use the `git pull` command. This command will fetch the latest changes from the remote repository and merge them into your local repository.

# Step 2: Resolve Conflicts

If there are any conflicts between the remote changes and your local changes, you will need to resolve them before you can continue. To do this, use the `git status` command to see which files have conflicts. Then, open the conflicted files and manually edit them to resolve the conflicts.

# Step 3: Commit Your Changes

Once you have resolved the conflicts, you can commit your changes to the local repository. Use the `git commit` command to commit your changes.

# Step 4: Push to Remote Repository

Finally, you can push your changes to the remote repository. Use the `git push` command to push your changes to the remote repository. This will override the changes in the remote repository with your local changes.
