## Yes
Git can tell you if a merge will conflict without actually merging. This can be done using the `git merge --no-commit --no-ff` command. This command will perform a "dry run" of the merge, which will check for conflicts without actually merging. 

## How
To use this command, you must first switch to the branch you want to merge into. Then, you can run the `git merge --no-commit --no-ff` command and specify the branch you want to merge from. This will check for any conflicts between the two branches and output the results. 

## Benefits
This command has several benefits. First, it allows you to check for conflicts before actually merging, which can save time and effort. Second, it can help you identify potential problems before they arise. Finally, it can help you avoid making mistakes when merging branches. 

## Conclusion
In conclusion, git can tell you if a merge will conflict without actually merging. This can be done using the `git merge --no-commit --no-ff` command, which will check for conflicts without actually merging. This command has several benefits, including saving time and effort, identifying potential problems, and avoiding mistakes.
