#### What is Pushing in Git?

Pushing in Git is the process of sending local commits to a remote repository. It is the opposite of pulling, which retrieves data from a remote repository. Pushing is necessary when you want to share your work with others or make it available for them to use.

#### Why is it Necessary to Push a New Branch?

When you create a new branch in Git, the changes you make on that branch are not visible to other users. To make the changes visible, you must push the branch to the remote repository. This allows other users to pull the branch and view the changes you have made.

Additionally, pushing a new branch ensures that your local changes are backed up in a remote repository. This makes it easier to recover from any accidental deletions or corruption of local files.

#### Benefits of Pushing a New Branch

Pushing a new branch has many benefits, including:

- Ensuring that changes are backed up in a remote repository
- Making changes visible to other users
- Allowing users to pull the branch and view the changes
- Providing an easy way to collaborate with others on the same project
- Making it easier to recover from any accidental deletions or corruption of local files
