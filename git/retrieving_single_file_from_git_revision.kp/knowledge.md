### Checkout the Specific Revision
To retrieve a single file from a specific revision in Git, first use the `git checkout` command to checkout the specific revision of the file:

```
git checkout <revision> <file>
```

### Retrieve the File
Once the specific revision of the file has been checked out, the file can be retrieved using the `git show` command:

```
git show <revision>:<file>
```

### Save the File
The file can then be saved to the local file system using the `git show` command:

```
git show <revision>:<file> > <filename>
```

### Cleanup
Finally, to clean up, use the `git checkout` command to checkout the HEAD revision of the file:

```
git checkout <file>
```
