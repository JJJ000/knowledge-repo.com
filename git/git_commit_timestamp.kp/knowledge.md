# What is a Git Commit Date?
A Git commit date is the date and time that a commit was made to a Git repository. It is recorded in the commit log and is used to track the history of changes made to the repository.

# How is the Date Recorded?
The date and time of a Git commit is recorded in the commit log with the following format: `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`. This format is used to ensure that all commits are recorded in the same format, regardless of the user's time zone or locale.

# How is the Date Used?
The date and time of a commit is used to track the history of changes made to a Git repository. This allows users to easily see when changes were made, who made them, and what those changes were. It also allows users to compare different versions of the same file and identify when changes were made.

# How Can I View the Date of a Commit?
The date and time of a commit can be viewed in the commit log. This can be done by running the command `git log` in the terminal. This will display a list of all commits made to the repository, along with their date and time.
