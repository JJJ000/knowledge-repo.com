tldr: The .gitignore file must be updated to include the .idea path.

**Contents**

[TOC]

# Cause

The .idea folder is not being ignored by the .gitignore file because of the lack of an absolute path. 

# Solution

To fix this issue, the path should be specified in the .gitignore file. For example, to ignore the entire .idea folder, the following line should be added to the .gitignore file:

```
/path/to/project/.idea/
```

This will ensure that the entire .idea folder and its contents are ignored by Git.

# Additional Considerations

It is also important to note that the .gitignore file should be placed in the root directory of the project. This ensures that any paths specified in the .gitignore file are relative to the root directory of the project.

Additionally, the .gitignore file should be checked into version control so that all members of the team are aware of what is being ignored by Git.
