# Step 1: Checkout the Target Branch

The first step is to switch to the branch you want to merge your current branch into. This can be done with the command `git checkout <target-branch>`.

# Step 2: Merge the Current Branch

Once you have checked out the target branch, you can merge the current branch into it using the command `git merge <current-branch>`.

# Step 3: Resolve Conflicts (If Necessary)

If there are any conflicts between the two branches, you will need to resolve them before the merge can be completed. This can be done by manually editing the files and resolving the conflicts.

# Step 4: Push the Changes

Once you have resolved the conflicts and the merge is complete, you can push the changes to the remote repository with the command `git push`.
