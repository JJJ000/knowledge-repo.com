# Deleting a Branch With TortoiseGit

## Step 1: Select the Branch

The first step is to select the branch that you would like to delete. To do this, open the TortoiseGit repository browser, right-click the branch you would like to delete and select “Delete branch”.

## Step 2: Confirm the Deletion

Next, you will be prompted to confirm the deletion. Select “Yes” to proceed.

## Step 3: Push the Changes

Once the branch has been deleted, you will need to push the changes to the remote repository. To do this, open the TortoiseGit repository browser, right-click the branch and select “Push”.

## Step 4: Verify the Deletion

Finally, to verify that the branch has been successfully deleted, open the TortoiseGit repository browser and check that the branch is no longer listed.
