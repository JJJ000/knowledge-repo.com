# Pulling a Different Branch

## Step 1: Check Out the Branch

The first step in pulling a different branch is to check out the branch. This can be done using the command `git checkout <branch-name>`.

## Step 2: Pull the Branch

Once the branch has been checked out, the next step is to pull the branch. This can be done using the command `git pull origin <branch-name>`.

## Step 3: Merge the Branch

The last step is to merge the branch. This can be done using the command `git merge <branch-name>`.
