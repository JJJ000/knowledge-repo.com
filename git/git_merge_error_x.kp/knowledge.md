### Overview
When attempting to delete a branch in Git, one may encounter the error message "error: The branch 'x' is not fully merged". This error occurs when attempting to delete a branch that still contains commits that have not been merged into the current branch.

### Causes
The error occurs because Git requires all commits in a branch to be merged into the current branch before the branch can be deleted. If the branch contains commits that have not been merged, then Git will not allow it to be deleted.

### Solutions
The simplest solution is to merge the commits from the branch into the current branch. This can be done using the `git merge` command. Once the commits have been merged, the branch can then be deleted using the `git branch -d` command.

Another solution is to delete the branch without merging the commits. This can be done using the `git branch -D` command. This command will delete the branch without merging the commits, but it should only be used as a last resort as it may cause data loss.
