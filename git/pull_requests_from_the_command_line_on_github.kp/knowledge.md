### No

GitHub pull requests must be issued through the GitHub website. The command line can be used to interact with GitHub, but pull requests must be created and managed through the GitHub website.

### What Can Be Done from the Command Line

While pull requests cannot be issued from the command line, other actions related to pull requests can be done from the command line. For example, developers can push code to a repository, create branches, and merge branches from the command line. Additionally, developers can use the command line to check the status of a pull request and comment on an existing pull request.

### Reasons for Not Allowing Pull Requests from the Command Line

GitHub does not allow pull requests to be issued from the command line for several reasons. Pull requests are complex, and issuing them requires a user interface to properly explain the changes being proposed. Additionally, issuing pull requests from the command line would require a more comprehensive authentication process than is currently available. Finally, allowing pull requests to be issued from the command line would require GitHub to create a more complex command line interface than is currently available.
