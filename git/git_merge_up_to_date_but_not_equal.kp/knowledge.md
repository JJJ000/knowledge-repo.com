tldr: This means that the branch you are trying to merge is already up-to-date with the branch you are merging into, so no changes need to be made.

### Possible Reasons
1. The difference is in different branches
2. Local changes have not been committed

### Explanation 
1. The message "Already up-to-date" is displayed when the branches being merged have no commits that are unique to one branch and not the other. This means that both branches have the same commits and the same content. 

2. If the difference between the branches is in local changes that have not been committed, then the difference will not be detected by Git and the message "Already up-to-date" will be displayed. This is because Git only checks the committed changes when performing a merge.
