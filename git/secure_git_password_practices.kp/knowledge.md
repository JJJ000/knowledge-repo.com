## Storing Passwords

The best practice for dealing with passwords in git repositories is to avoid storing them in the repository altogether. Instead, passwords should be stored in a separate, secure location and accessed via environment variables.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are a secure way to store and access passwords. They are not stored in the repository and are instead set up on the machine that is running the project. This prevents passwords from being exposed to anyone with access to the repository.

## Encryption

If passwords must be stored in the repository, they should be encrypted. This prevents anyone who has access to the repository from being able to view the passwords in plain text.

## Documentation

Finally, it is important to document the process for setting up environment variables or encrypting passwords in the repository. This ensures that anyone who needs to access the passwords knows how to do so.
