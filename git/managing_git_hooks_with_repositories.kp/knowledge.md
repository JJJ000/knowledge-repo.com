[TOC]

### Yes

Git hook scripts can be managed along with the repository. This means that when a user clones the repository, the hook scripts will be included. Hook scripts can be stored in the `.git/hooks` directory, which is located in the root of the repository. The `.git/hooks` directory contains a set of example scripts, which can be used as templates for writing custom scripts.

### Benefits

Managing hook scripts along with the repository allows for them to be versioned and tracked, just like any other file. This means that changes to the scripts can be tracked and reverted, if necessary. Additionally, managing hook scripts along with the repository allows for them to be shared with other users who have access to the repository.

### Challenges

The main challenge with managing hook scripts along with the repository is that the scripts must be manually installed on each system that needs to use them. This means that the scripts must be manually copied from the repository to the `.git/hooks` directory on each system. Additionally, if the scripts are updated in the repository, they must be manually updated on each system.
