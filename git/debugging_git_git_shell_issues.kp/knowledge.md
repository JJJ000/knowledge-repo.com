## Check the Logs

The first step to debug any git/git-shell related problems is to check the logs. The git log command will show the commit history and any errors that may have occurred. If there are any errors, they should be addressed before proceeding.

## Check the Configuration

The second step to debug any git/git-shell related problems is to check the configuration. The git config command allows you to view and edit the configuration settings. It is important to ensure that the correct settings are in place and that no settings have been changed that could cause issues.

## Test the Repository

The third step to debug any git/git-shell related problems is to test the repository. This can be done by cloning the repository and running the git status command to see if there are any errors. If there are errors, they should be addressed before proceeding.

## Troubleshoot

The fourth step to debug any git/git-shell related problems is to troubleshoot. This can be done by running the git --help command to view the available commands and their options. If necessary, the git-shell command can be used to access the git-shell environment and debug any issues.
