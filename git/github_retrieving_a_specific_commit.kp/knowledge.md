# Section 1: Download the Project

The first step to getting a certain commit from a GitHub project is to download the project. This can be done by either cloning the repository or downloading the project as a zip file. 

# Section 2: Find the Commit

Once the project is downloaded, the next step is to find the commit that you are looking for. This can be done by looking at the project's commit history. All commits will have a unique ID associated with them. 

# Section 3: Checkout the Commit

Once the commit has been identified, the next step is to checkout the commit. This can be done using the git checkout command. The command should include the commit ID of the commit that you are looking for. 

# Section 4: Pull the Commit

The final step is to pull the commit. This can be done using the git pull command. This will pull the commit from the repository and make it available to be used.
