# Solution

## Background
Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files.

## Passphrase
A passphrase is a sequence of words or other text used to control access to a computer system, program or data. Passphrases are typically longer and more complex than a password and can be used to provide an additional layer of security.

## Windows
Windows is an operating system developed by Microsoft. It is the most popular operating system for personal computers, and is used in businesses, government and educational institutions around the world.

## Problem
Git does not store or remember passphrases on Windows, and users must enter the passphrase each time they access a repository. This is a security measure to ensure that only authorized users are able to access the repository.
