### What Causes This Issue?
This issue occurs when the local changes you have made have not been tracked by Git. This means that the changes have not been staged and committed, and as a result, Git does not recognize them as changes that need to be pushed to the remote repository.

### How to Resolve
1. Stage the changes: To stage the changes, use the command `git add <file>` to add the changes you have made to the staging area. This will tell Git to track the changes.
2. Commit the changes: Once the changes have been staged, use the command `git commit -m "Commit message"` to commit the changes to the local repository.
3. Push the changes: Finally, use the command `git push` to push the changes to the remote repository.

### Tips
It is a good practice to commit and push changes regularly to ensure that your local and remote repositories are in sync. This will help prevent issues such as this one from occurring.
