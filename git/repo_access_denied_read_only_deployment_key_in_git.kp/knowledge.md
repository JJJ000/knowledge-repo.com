### Overview

Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to collaborate on code without having to worry about overwriting each other's work. A deployment key is a secure way of accessing a repository without needing to use a username and password. However, when using a deployment key, the access to the repository is limited and is read-only.

### Benefits of Read-Only Access

Using a deployment key to access a repository with read-only access has several benefits. First, it ensures that developers are not able to make any changes to the code in the repository without permission. This makes it easier to keep track of changes and ensure that the code is secure. Additionally, it prevents developers from accidentally overwriting each other's work, which can lead to costly mistakes.

### Disadvantages of Read-Only Access

The main disadvantage of using a deployment key to access a repository with read-only access is that it limits the ability of developers to collaborate on the code. Since they are not able to make any changes to the code, they cannot contribute their own ideas or collaborate with others. Additionally, it can be difficult to troubleshoot code when developers are not able to edit the code themselves.

### Conclusion

Using a deployment key to access a repository with read-only access can be beneficial in certain situations, such as when security is a priority. However, it can also limit the ability of developers to collaborate on the code and make it more difficult to troubleshoot. Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to use a deployment key with read-only access should be based on the specific needs of the project.
