### Accessing the Log

The first step to showing the first commit is to access the log. This can be done by running the command `git log` in the terminal.

### Filtering the Log

The log can be filtered to show only the first commit by adding the `--reverse` flag to the command. This will display the commits in reverse chronological order, with the most recent commit at the bottom and the first commit at the top. 

### Viewing the First Commit

Once the log has been filtered, the first commit can be viewed by scrolling to the top of the log. The first commit will be at the top and will be marked as the initial commit.

### Exiting the Log

Once the first commit has been viewed, exit the log by pressing `q` on the keyboard. This will return the user to the terminal.
