###### Network Problem

If the push is hanging after the Total line, it could be due to a network problem. This could be caused by a slow connection, a timeout, or a disruption in the connection.

###### Local Problem

It could also be an issue with the local environment. This could be due to a lack of resources such as memory or disk space, or a problem with the local git configuration.

###### Source Control Problem

It could also be a problem with the source control system. This could be due to an issue with the remote repository, or a problem with the authentication credentials.

###### Other Issues

Finally, it could be an issue with the code itself. This could be due to a conflict between the local and remote versions of the code, or a problem with the code that is preventing it from being pushed.
