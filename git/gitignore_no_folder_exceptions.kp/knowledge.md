[TOC]

#### Ignoring Files

Gitignore is used to ignore specific files, directories, and file patterns. It is important to note that Gitignore does not ignore folders, but rather the files within them.

#### Ignoring File Patterns

Gitignore can be used to ignore certain file patterns, such as all files with the .txt extension. This means that any .txt files in the specified folder will not be tracked by Git.

#### Ignoring Directories

Gitignore can also be used to ignore entire directories. This means that any files within the specified directory will not be tracked by Git.

#### Ignoring Subdirectories

Gitignore can also be used to ignore subdirectories. This means that any files within the specified subdirectory will not be tracked by Git.
