#1 Cloning the Repo

Clone the local repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command. This will create a local copy of the repository on your machine.

#2 Adding the Remote

Once you have cloned the repository, you can add the local repository as a remote repository in Git. This can be done using the `git remote add` command.

#3 Pushing to the Remote

Once the remote repository has been added, you can push your changes to the remote repository using the `git push` command.

#4 Pulling from the Remote

Finally, you can pull changes from the remote repository using the `git pull` command. This will ensure that your local repository is always up to date with the remote repository.
