## What is Rebasing?

Rebasing is a Git feature that allows you to take a series of commits and apply them to a different base commit. This can be used to keep a linear history of commits, or to combine several commits into one.

## What is a Fatal Error?

A fatal error is an error that is so severe that it prevents the program from continuing. In the case of a Git rebase, a fatal error indicates that the command was not successful.

## What Causes a Fatal Error When Rebasing?

A fatal error when rebasing can be caused by a number of different issues. These can include trying to rebase onto a branch that does not exist, attempting to rebase a branch that has already been rebased, or trying to rebase a commit that does not exist.

## How to Fix a Fatal Error When Rebasing

The best way to fix a fatal error when rebasing is to identify the cause of the error and then take steps to fix it. For example, if the error is caused by attempting to rebase a branch that does not exist, then the user should create the branch and then try the rebase command again. If the error is caused by trying to rebase a commit that does not exist, then the user should identify the correct commit and then try the rebase command again.
