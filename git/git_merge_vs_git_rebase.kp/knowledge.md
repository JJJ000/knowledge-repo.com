### Git Merge
Git Merge is a command used to integrate changes from one branch into another branch. It combines multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. It is used when two branches have different changes and need to be combined.

### Git Rebase
Git Rebase is a command used to integrate changes from one branch onto another branch. It takes all the changes from one branch and replays them onto the other branch. It is used when two branches have the same changes and need to be combined.
