tldr: You need to set an upstream branch for the current branch in order for Git to track it.

### Introduction

When working with Git, it is important to understand the concept of upstream branches. A branch in Git is a pointer to a specific commit in the repository. The upstream branch is the branch that the current branch is tracking. It is the branch that the current branch will be pushed to and pulled from.

### What is an Upstream Branch?

An upstream branch is the branch that the current branch is tracking. It is the branch that the current branch will be pushed to and pulled from. The upstream branch is the branch that the current branch is based off of. It is typically the branch that the current branch was created from.

### What Happens When the Current Branch Has No Upstream Branch?

When the current branch has no upstream branch, it means that the branch is not tracking any other branch. This can happen if the branch was created without specifying an upstream branch, or if the branch was created from a commit that is not part of any other branch. In this case, the branch will not be able to be pushed or pulled from any other branch.

### Conclusion

Understanding the concept of upstream branches is important when working with Git. When the current branch has no upstream branch, it means that the branch is not tracking any other branch and cannot be pushed or pulled from any other branch.
