## What is git branch --unset-upstream?
git branch --unset-upstream is a command that can be used to remove the upstream tracking information for the current branch. This is useful when the upstream branch has been deleted or when the upstream branch has been rebased and the tracking information needs to be updated.

## Why is it used to fixup?
git branch --unset-upstream is commonly used to fixup errors related to upstream tracking information. For example, if the upstream branch has been deleted, this command can be used to remove the tracking information and avoid errors when pushing or pulling from the upstream.

## How does it work?
When the command is run, it removes the tracking information stored in the local repository. This allows the local repository to be synchronized with the upstream branch without any errors.

## What are the benefits?
Using git branch --unset-upstream to fixup errors related to upstream tracking information can help avoid conflicts and ensure that the local repository is synchronized with the upstream branch. Additionally, it can help avoid errors when pushing or pulling from the upstream.
