tldr: It is not possible to update paths and switch to a branch at the same time in Git.

**Contents**

[TOC]

## Explanation

Git does not allow users to update paths and switch to a branch at the same time because it would cause a conflict between the two operations. When switching to a branch, the working tree is updated to reflect the contents of the branch. If the paths were updated at the same time, it could lead to inconsistencies in the working tree and could cause problems with the repository.

## Solution

The best way to avoid this issue is to ensure that the paths are updated before switching to a branch. This can be done by using the git reset command to reset the paths to the desired state. After the paths have been updated, the user can then switch to the desired branch.

## Alternative

An alternative approach is to use the git stash command to save the changes to the paths before switching branches. This will store the changes in a temporary location and allow the user to switch to the desired branch without affecting the paths. After switching branches, the user can then apply the stashed changes to the new branch.
