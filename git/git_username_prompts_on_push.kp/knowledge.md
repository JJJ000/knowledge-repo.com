### Overview
Git is a version control system that is used to track changes to files and directories over time. It can be used to store and share code, track changes, and collaborate with other developers. When pushing code to a remote repository, Git may ask for a username and password. This is because the remote repository requires authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access it.

### Reasons for Requiring Authentication
Git requires authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the remote repository. This is important for security reasons, as it helps protect the repository from unauthorized access and potential malicious activity.

### How to Provide Authentication
When prompted for a username and password, simply enter the credentials provided by the remote repository. If you do not have the credentials, you can contact the repository's administrator to obtain them.

### Conclusion
Git requires authentication when pushing code to a remote repository to ensure that only authorized users can access it. To provide authentication, simply enter the credentials provided by the remote repository, or contact the repository's administrator to obtain them.
