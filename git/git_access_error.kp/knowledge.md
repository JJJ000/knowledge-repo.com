### Solution
### Check Access Rights
The first step when troubleshooting this error is to check the access rights of the repository. Make sure that you have the correct permissions to access the repository. If you are not the owner of the repository, contact the owner to ensure that you have the correct permissions.

### Check Repository Existence
The second step is to check the existence of the repository. If the repository does not exist, the error message will appear. You can check the existence of the repository by searching for it online or by using the command line.

### Troubleshoot Git
If the repository exists and you have the correct access rights, then the next step is to troubleshoot Git. Check that Git is installed correctly and that you are using the correct version of Git. Additionally, make sure that the remote repository URL is correct.
