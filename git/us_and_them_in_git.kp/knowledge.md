## Us 
In Git, "us" typically refers to the repository's contributors. This includes developers, designers, testers, and other personnel who have access to the repository and can make changes to it.

## Them
In Git, "them" typically refers to external entities that have access to the repository but cannot make changes to it. This includes external users, such as customers or other stakeholders, who may have access to view the repository but cannot modify it.
