### Push Commits

To push commits to a remote repository, use the `git push` command. This command will push all of the commits that have been made locally to the remote repository.

### Push Tags

To push tags to a remote repository, use the `git push --tags` command. This command will push all of the tags that have been made locally to the remote repository.

### Push Commits and Tags Simultaneously

To push commits and tags simultaneously to a remote repository, use the `git push --all` command. This command will push all of the commits and tags that have been made locally to the remote repository.

### Push Commits and Tags Separately

To push commits and tags separately to a remote repository, use the `git push` command to push the commits, and the `git push --tags` command to push the tags. This will ensure that only the commits or tags that you have specified are pushed to the remote repository.
