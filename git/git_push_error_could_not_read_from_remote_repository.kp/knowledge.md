## Cause

Git push is used to push changes from the local repository to a remote repository. This error occurs when the remote repository does not exist or is not configured correctly.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, the remote repository must be configured correctly. This can be done by running the following commands:

1. `git remote add origin <remote-repository-url>` 
2. `git push -u origin master`

This will configure the remote repository and push the changes to it.
