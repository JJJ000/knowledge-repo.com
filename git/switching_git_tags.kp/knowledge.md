[TOC]

## Checkout the Tag

To switch to another tag, use the `git checkout` command with the tag name.

```
git checkout <tag_name>
```

## Verify the Checkout

To verify that you have successfully switched to the desired tag, use the `git status` command.

```
git status
```

This will display the current branch and tag that you are on.

## Pull the Tag

If the tag you are switching to is not present locally, you can pull it from the remote repository.

```
git pull origin <tag_name>
```

This will pull the tag from the remote repository and add it to your local repository.

## Push the Tag

If you have made changes to the tag, you can push it to the remote repository.

```
git push origin <tag_name>
```

This will push the changes to the remote repository and update the tag on the remote repository.
