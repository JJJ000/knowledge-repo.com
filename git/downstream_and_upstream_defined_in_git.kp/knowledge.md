### Downstream

Downstream in Git refers to the process of receiving data from a remote repository. This process is also known as "pulling" or "fetching" in Git. During the downstream process, the local repository is updated with the latest version of the remote repository.

### Upstream

Upstream in Git refers to the process of sending data to a remote repository. This process is also known as "pushing" or "committing" in Git. During the upstream process, the local repository is synchronized with the remote repository by sending the changes made in the local repository to the remote repository.
