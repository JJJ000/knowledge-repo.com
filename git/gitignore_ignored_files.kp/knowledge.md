### git check-ignore

The `git check-ignore` command allows you to check which files are being ignored by `.gitignore` rules. It takes a pathname as an argument, and it returns the name of the file or directory and the rule that is ignoring it.

### Syntax

The syntax for `git check-ignore` is as follows:

```
git check-ignore [-v] [--no-index] [--stdin] [--] <pathname>â€¦
```

### Examples

For example, to check which files are being ignored in the current directory, you can run the following command:

```
git check-ignore .
```

To check which files are being ignored in a specific directory, you can run the following command:

```
git check-ignore path/to/directory
```
