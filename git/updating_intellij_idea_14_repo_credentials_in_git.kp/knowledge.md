# Section 1: Accessing the Remote Repository

First, you need to access the remote repository. You can do this by going to the **VCS** menu and selecting **Git** > **Remotes**. This will open the **Git Remotes** window, where you can view and manage your remote repositories.

# Section 2: Editing the Credentials

Once you have the remote repository open, you can edit the credentials by clicking the **Edit** button. This will open the **Edit Remote** window, where you can enter your new credentials.

# Section 3: Saving the Changes

Once you have entered the new credentials, click the **OK** button to save the changes. This will update the remote repository with your new credentials.

# Section 4: Testing the Changes

Finally, you can test the changes by attempting to push or pull from the remote repository. If the credentials have been updated correctly, the push/pull should succeed.
