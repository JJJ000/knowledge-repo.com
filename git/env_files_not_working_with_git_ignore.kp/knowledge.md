# Troubleshooting

## Check the Syntax

The `.gitignore` file uses patterns to match files that should be ignored. The syntax of these patterns is important and can be difficult to get right. To ensure that the `.gitignore` file is correctly formatted, check that all lines are valid patterns and there are no trailing spaces.

## Check the File Paths

Make sure that the file paths in the `.gitignore` file are relative to the root of the repository. If the `.gitignore` file is in a different directory, the paths must be adjusted accordingly.

## Check the Order

The order of the patterns in the `.gitignore` file is important. Patterns that come later in the file can override patterns that come earlier. If a file is not being ignored, check that the pattern for the file is not being overridden by a later pattern.

## Check the Commits

If the `.gitignore` file has been changed and committed, the changes may not take effect until the file has been committed again. To make sure that the changes are applied, commit the `.gitignore` file again after making any changes.
