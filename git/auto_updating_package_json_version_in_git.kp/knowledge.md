# Section 1: Understanding the Problem

Before attempting to update the version of a package.json file in Git, it is important to understand the problem. The package.json file is a text file that stores information about a software project, including the version number. This version number is important for tracking changes in the project over time. In order for Git to be able to track these changes, the version number must be updated in the package.json file.

# Section 2: Setting Up Git

The first step in updating the package.json version in Git is to set up a repository for the project. This can be done by creating a new repository on Github or another online repository hosting service. Once the repository has been created, the project files can be added and committed to the repository.

# Section 3: Automating the Version Number Update

Once the repository has been set up, the next step is to automate the process of updating the version number in the package.json file. This can be done by using a tool such as npm-version-updater, which can be used to automatically update the version number in the package.json file.

# Section 4: Committing the Version Number Update

Once the version number has been updated, the final step is to commit the changes to the repository. This can be done by using the git commit command, which will add the changes to the repository and allow them to be tracked over time.
