### Advantages of HTTPS

1. Security: HTTPS is the most secure protocol for transferring data over the internet. It provides encryption of data and authentication of the server.

2. Compatibility: HTTPS is compatible with most web browsers and operating systems. It also works with most firewalls and proxies.

### Advantages of SSH

1. Authentication: SSH provides strong authentication of the server and client, which makes it more secure than HTTPS.

2. Performance: SSH is faster than HTTPS, as it does not need to establish an encrypted connection each time data is transferred.
