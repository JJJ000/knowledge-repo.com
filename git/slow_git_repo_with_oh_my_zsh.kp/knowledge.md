tldr: The slowness may be due to a large number of files in the Git repo.

## Possible Causes
1. Repository size: Large repositories with many files can take longer to clone and update.
2. Network speed: If the network connection is slow, it can take longer to clone and update the repository.
3. Credential caching: If credentials are not cached, it can take longer to authenticate with the remote repository.

## Troubleshooting
1. Check the size of the repository: Run `git count-objects -v` to get an idea of the size of the repository.
2. Check the network speed: Run a speed test to check the download and upload speeds of the network connection.
3. Check the credential caching: Run `git config credential.helper` to check if credentials are cached.

## Solutions
1. Increase network speed: If the network connection is slow, try switching to a faster network connection.
2. Increase credential caching: If credentials are not cached, try setting up credential caching with `git config --global credential.helper <credential-helper>`.
3. Optimize repository size: If the repository is large, try optimizing it by removing unnecessary files or using shallow cloning.
