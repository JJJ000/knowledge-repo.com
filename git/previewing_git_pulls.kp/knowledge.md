# Section 1: Clone the Repository

The first step to previewing a git pull is to clone the repository. Cloning the repository will give you a local version of the repository that you can use to view the changes before you pull them. To clone the repository, use the command: `git clone [repository URL]`.

# Section 2: Checkout the Branch

Once you have cloned the repository, you can checkout the branch that you are interested in previewing. To do this, use the command `git checkout [branch name]`. This will switch your local repository to the branch that you specified.

# Section 3: Pull the Changes

Once you have checked out the branch, you can then pull the changes to view them. To do this, use the command `git pull`. This will download the changes from the remote repository and apply them to your local repository.

# Section 4: View the Changes

After you have pulled the changes, you can then view them. You can do this by using a GUI tool like SourceTree or by using the command `git diff`. This will show you the differences between your local repository and the remote repository.
