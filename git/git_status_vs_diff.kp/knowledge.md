# Git Status
Git status shows the state of the working directory, the index, and the current branch. It will also show any changes that have been made to the working directory since the last commit. It will also show any files that have been added or removed from the repository.

# Git Diff
Git diff shows the differences between two commits. It will show the changes made to each file between the two commits. It will also show any files that have been added or removed from the repository. It will not show any changes that have been made to the working directory since the last commit.
