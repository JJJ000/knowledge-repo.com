1. Introduction 
A Pull Request (PR) is a way of submitting changes to a repository on GitHub. It allows users to submit changes to a repository and then have those changes merged into the main branch of the repository. A commit is a snapshot of the changes that have been made to a repository. When a commit is created, it is added to the repository's history and can be seen by anyone who has access to the repository.

2. How to Find a Pull Request with a Commit 
To find a Pull Request that has a commit, you can use the GitHub search feature. By searching for "is:pr is:merged" you can find all the Pull Requests that have been merged into the repository. From there, you can click on the Pull Request to view the commits that were included in the Pull Request.

3. Example of a Pull Request with a Commit 
For example, you can find a Pull Request with a commit on the React repository. The Pull Request is titled "Fix: use strict mode in production builds (#17500)". This Pull Request includes a commit that fixes an issue with the strict mode in production builds. 

4. Conclusion 
In conclusion, Pull Requests are a great way to submit changes to a repository on GitHub. By using the search feature, you can easily find Pull Requests that have a commit associated with them. This makes it easy to view the changes that have been made and to ensure that the changes are correct.
