### Removing the Files
1. To remove the files from the repository, you can use the `git rm` command. This command will remove the file from the repository and delete it from the working directory.

2. You can also use the `git reset` command to remove the files from the repository. This command will remove the file from the repository but it will not delete it from the working directory.

### Adding the Files to .gitignore
1. To prevent the files from being committed to the repository again, you can add them to the `.gitignore` file. This file tells Git which files should not be tracked and committed to the repository.

2. You can add the files to the `.gitignore` file by either manually entering the file names or using a wildcard pattern to match all files in the directory. For example, if you wanted to ignore all files in the `.idea` directory, you could add the following line to the `.gitignore` file: `.idea/*`.
