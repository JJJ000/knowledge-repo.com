# File Extension 
Git treats a file as binary if it has a file extension that is not in its list of recognized text file extensions. Binary files are treated differently than text files because they contain data that cannot be represented as plain text.

# File Content 
Git may also treat a file as a binary file if it contains data that is not human-readable. For example, if a text file contains a large amount of binary data, Git will not be able to interpret it and will treat it as a binary file.

# File Size 
Git may also treat a file as a binary file if it is larger than a certain size. This is to ensure that the file is not too large for Git to process.

# File Format 
Git may also treat a file as a binary file if it is not in a format that it can interpret. For example, if the file is in a proprietary format, Git may not be able to interpret it and will treat it as a binary file.
