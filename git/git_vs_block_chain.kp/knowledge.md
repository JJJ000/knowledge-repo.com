tldr: Git is not a block chain because it does not use cryptographic hashing and a distributed ledger system to store and validate data.

### Definition of Block Chain
A block chain is a distributed ledger technology that records and stores data across a network of computers, allowing for the secure transfer of digital assets and information. It is a continuously growing list of records, called blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, a block chain is resistant to modification of the data.

### Definition of Git
Git is a distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.

### Difference
Git is not a block chain technology because it does not record and store data across a network of computers, nor does it use cryptography to secure the data. Additionally, it does not use a continuously growing list of records, or blocks, to track changes. Instead, it uses a system of commits and branches to track changes to source code.
