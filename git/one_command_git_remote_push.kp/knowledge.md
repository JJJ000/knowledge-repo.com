[TOC]

# Yes 
It is possible to push to multiple git remotes with one command.

# How
To push to multiple git remotes, you can use the `git push --all` command. This command will push all of your local commits to all of your remotes.

# Benefits
Using this command can save time and effort, as you don't have to manually push to each remote repository. It also ensures that all of your remotes are kept up to date.

# Caveats
When using the `git push --all` command, it is important to note that it will push all of your local commits to all of your remotes. This can cause unexpected results if you are not careful. It is recommended to use the `git push --all --dry-run` command first to ensure that the push will have the desired effect.
