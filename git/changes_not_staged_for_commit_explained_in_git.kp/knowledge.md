### Overview

"Changes not staged for commit" is a message that appears in Git when changes have been made to a file, but the changes have not been added to the staging area. This message indicates that the changes will not be included in the next commit unless they are added to the staging area.

### What is the Staging Area?

The staging area is a place where changes to files can be tracked and managed before they are committed to the repository. When changes are made to a file, they are not automatically added to the staging area. Instead, the user must explicitly add the changes to the staging area before they can be committed.

### What Does "Changes Not Staged for Commit" Mean?

When changes have been made to a file, but they have not been added to the staging area, Git will display the message "Changes not staged for commit". This message indicates that the changes will not be included in the next commit unless they are added to the staging area.

### How to Stage Changes

To stage changes, the user must use the `git add` command. This command will add the changes to the staging area, allowing them to be included in the next commit.
