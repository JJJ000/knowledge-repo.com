### Aborting the Merge

To abort the merge, you can use the command `git merge --abort` in the terminal. This will revert the repository to the state before the merge was attempted.

### Resolving Merge Conflicts

If the merge conflict is caused by a file, you can use the command `git mergetool` to open a visual tool that can help you resolve the conflict. This tool will show you both versions of the conflicting files and allow you to choose which version to keep.

### More Information

If you need more information about resolving merge conflicts, you can refer to the official Git documentation [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge).
