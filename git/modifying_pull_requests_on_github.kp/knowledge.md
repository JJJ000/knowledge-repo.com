[TOC]

## Section 1: Checking Out the Pull Request

To modify a pull request on GitHub to change the target branch to merge into, the first step is to check out the pull request. This can be done by navigating to the repository, clicking on the “Pull Requests” tab, and selecting the pull request that needs to be modified.

## Section 2: Changing the Target Branch

Once the pull request has been opened, the target branch can be changed by clicking the “Edit” button in the top right corner of the page. This will open a menu where the target branch can be changed. After selecting the desired branch, click the “Update” button to save the changes.

## Section 3: Verifying the Change

Once the changes have been saved, the pull request can be verified to ensure that the target branch has been changed correctly. This can be done by navigating to the “Files changed” tab and checking that the target branch is set to the desired branch.

## Section 4: Submitting the Change

Once the change has been verified, the pull request can be submitted by clicking the “Submit” button at the bottom of the page. This will update the pull request with the new target branch and will be ready for merging.
