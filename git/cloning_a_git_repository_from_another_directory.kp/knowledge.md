### Step 1: Navigate to Desired Directory

In order to clone a repository from another directory, you must first navigate to the directory you want to clone the repository into. This can be done by using the `cd` command.

### Step 2: Clone Repository

Once you are in the desired directory, you can clone the repository by running the command `git clone <repository URL>` in the terminal. The repository URL can be found on the repository's page on the hosting website.

### Step 3: Check Cloned Repository

Once the repository has been cloned, you can check it by running the command `git status`. This will show you the current status of the repository, including any changes that have been made.

### Step 4: Push Changes

If you want to push any changes you have made to the repository, you can do so by running the command `git push origin master`. This will push all changes to the remote repository.
