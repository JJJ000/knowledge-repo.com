### Checkout the version

In order to diff one file to an arbitrary version in Git, the first step is to checkout the version you want to compare to. To do this, you can use the `git checkout` command with the commit hash of the version you want to compare to.

### Diff the File

Once you have checked out the version you want to compare to, you can then use the `git diff` command to diff the file. The command should look something like this: 

`git diff <commit_hash> <file_name>`

### View the Diff

Once you have run the command, the diff of the file will be displayed in your terminal. You can then view the diff and compare the versions of the file.

### Checkout the Current Version

Once you have finished viewing the diff, you can then use the `git checkout` command to checkout the current version of the file. This will allow you to continue working on the file without any changes to the version you compared it to.
