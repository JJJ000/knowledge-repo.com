### Linking to a Specific Line Number

1. Navigate to the desired file on GitHub and locate the line number of interest.
2. Copy the URL of the file and add `#L<line_number>` to the end.
3. The resulting URL will link directly to the specified line number.

### Example

For example, to link to line 8 of the `README.md` file in the `example-repo` repository, the URL would be `https://github.com/example-repo/README.md#L8`.
