### Solution

### Causes
The most common cause of this error is that the remote server has closed the connection due to inactivity. It could also be caused by a misconfigured firewall, incorrect SSH settings, or a network issue.

### Troubleshooting
The first step in troubleshooting this error is to check the server logs for any errors. If the server logs do not provide any clues, then the next step is to check the network settings and firewall configurations. If those are correct, then the next step is to check the SSH settings.

### Resolution
If the issue is due to inactivity, then increasing the timeout settings on the server should resolve the issue. If the issue is due to a misconfigured firewall or incorrect SSH settings, then those settings should be corrected. If the issue is due to a network issue, then the network should be checked for any problems.

### Prevention
To prevent this error from occurring in the future, it is important to ensure that the server timeout settings are appropriate and that the firewall and SSH settings are correct. Additionally, the network should be monitored for any potential issues.
