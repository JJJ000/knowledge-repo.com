# Section 1: Viewing Incoming Commits Locally

1. Use the `git log` command to view incoming commits. This command will show all commits made to the repository, including those that have not yet been pushed to the remote repository.

2. To view only the incoming commits, use the `git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all` command. This will show all commits in the repository, including those that have not yet been pushed to the remote repository, in a graph format.

# Section 2: Viewing Incoming Commits on Remote Repositories

1. If you are using a remote repository such as GitHub or Bitbucket, you can view incoming commits by navigating to the "Commits" page on the repository.

2. You can also view incoming commits by navigating to the "Pull Requests" page on the repository. This will show all pull requests that have been made to the repository, including those that have not yet been merged.

# Section 3: Viewing Incoming Commits in IDEs

1. If you are using an IDE such as IntelliJ or Visual Studio Code, you can view incoming commits by navigating to the "Git" tab in the IDE.

2. You can also view incoming commits by navigating to the "History" tab in the IDE. This will show all commits made to the repository, including those that have not yet been pushed to the remote repository.
