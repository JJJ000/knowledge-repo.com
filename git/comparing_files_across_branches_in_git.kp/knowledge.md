### Checkout the Branches

In order to compare files from two different branches in Git, the first step is to checkout the branches you wish to compare. This can be done by running the command `git checkout <branch_name>`.

### View the Files

Next, you can view the files in each branch by running the command `git show <branch_name>:<file_name>`. This will show the contents of the file in the specified branch.

### Compare the Files

Once you have viewed the files in each branch, you can compare them using the command `git diff <branch_name1>:<file_name> <branch_name2>:<file_name>`. This will show the differences between the two files.

### Merge the Branches

Finally, if you wish to merge the files from the two branches, you can do so by running the command `git merge <branch_name1> <branch_name2>`. This will merge the changes from both branches into a single branch.
