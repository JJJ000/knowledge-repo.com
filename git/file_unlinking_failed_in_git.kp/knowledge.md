tldr: Git does not support unlinking of files, so the only way to remove a file from a repository is to delete it.

## Unlinking a File

Unlinking a file in Git is a process of removing a file from the Git repository without deleting it from the local working directory. This is done through the `git rm` command. This command removes a file from the Git repository and stages the deletion, but the file is still present in the local working directory.

## Reasons for Unlinking a File

Unlinking a file in Git can be done for a variety of reasons. It can be used to remove a file from the repository without deleting it locally, or to remove a file that was mistakenly added to the repository. It can also be used to remove a file that has been modified and is no longer needed in the repository.

## Steps for Unlinking a File

1. Navigate to the local working directory.
2. Run the `git rm` command, followed by the name of the file to be removed.
3. Commit the changes with `git commit`.
4. Push the changes to the remote repository with `git push`.

## Troubleshooting

If the file is not removed from the repository after running the `git rm` command, it is likely that the file is still present in the local working directory. To remove the file from the repository, run the `git rm` command again, followed by the `--cached` flag. This will remove the file from the repository without deleting it from the local working directory.
