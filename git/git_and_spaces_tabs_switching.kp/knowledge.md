[TOC]

# No

Git does not have the ability to automatically switch between spaces and tabs. This is because it is a version control system and not a text editor.

# Text Editors

Text editors, such as Sublime Text or Atom, can be used to switch between spaces and tabs. These editors have the ability to recognize the difference between tabs and spaces and can be configured to automatically convert them.

# Configuration

The configuration for the text editor will depend on the type of text editor being used. For example, in Sublime Text, the user can set the tab size and the number of spaces to convert tabs to.

# Manual Conversion

If a text editor is not available, then the user can manually convert spaces to tabs and tabs to spaces. This can be done by using the “replace” feature in a text editor or by using a command line tool.
