### Possible Causes 
1. The connection between the two machines has been lost.
2. The server is experiencing a high volume of traffic.
3. The repository has been moved or deleted.
4. The repository is too large for the connection to handle.

### Troubleshooting
1. Check the connection between the two machines to ensure that it is stable.
2. Try cloning the repository at a different time when the server is less busy.
3. Confirm that the repository still exists and is accessible.
4. Reduce the size of the repository or use a different protocol to clone it.

### Prevention
1. Use a more reliable connection between the two machines.
2. Monitor the server to ensure that it is not overloaded.
3. Regularly check the repository to make sure it is still available.
4. Split large repositories into smaller chunks to make cloning easier.

### Conclusion
Cloning a repository remotely can be difficult if the connection is unreliable or the repository is too large. To prevent this issue, ensure that the connection is stable, monitor the server for traffic, regularly check the repository, and split large repositories into smaller chunks. If the remote end hangs up unexpectedly, troubleshoot the issue by checking the connection, trying to clone the repository at a different time, confirming that the repository still exists, and reducing the size of the repository.
