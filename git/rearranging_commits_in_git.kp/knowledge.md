# Reordering Commits

## Using Rebase
Rebasing is a powerful Git feature that allows you to reorder, edit, or delete commits. It can be used to combine multiple commits into one, or to split a single commit into multiple ones.

## Using Reset
Git reset is a command that allows you to reset the state of your repository to a previous commit. It can be used to undo commits, or to reset the HEAD pointer to a specific commit.

## Using Amend
Git amend is a command that allows you to edit the most recent commit. It can be used to add changes to the last commit, or to change the commit message.

## Using Cherry-Pick
Git cherry-pick is a command that allows you to copy specific commits from one branch to another. It can be used to selectively apply changes from one branch to another, or to reorder commits in a branch.
