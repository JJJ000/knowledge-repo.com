Git rebase is a powerful command that allows a user to rewrite the history of a repository. When attempting to perform a rebase, the user may encounter an error that reads "error: cannot stat 'file': Permission denied". This error occurs when the user does not have the necessary permissions to access the file in question. 

### Causes

This error is caused when the user does not have the necessary read or write permissions to access the file. In order to perform a rebase, the user must have read and write permissions to all of the files in the repository. 

### Solutions

The user can resolve this issue by ensuring that they have the necessary permissions to access the file. This can be done by running the command `chmod` on the file to give the user the necessary permissions. Additionally, the user can also use the command `sudo` to gain the necessary permissions to access the file. 

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the "error: cannot stat 'file': Permission denied" error occurs when the user does not have the necessary permissions to access the file. This can be resolved by running the `chmod` command on the file or by using the `sudo` command.
