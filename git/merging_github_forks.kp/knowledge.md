tldr: Forking a repository on GitHub allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project, and merging between forks can be done by creating a pull request from the forked repository to the original repository.

### Step 1: Fork the Repository 
First, you will need to fork the repository you want to merge into your own. You can do this by clicking the "Fork" button in the top right corner of the repository page. This will create a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account. 

### Step 2: Create a Pull Request 
Once you have forked the repository, you will need to create a pull request. To do this, go to the original repository and click the "New Pull Request" button. This will open a page where you can select the forked repository as the "head repository" and the original repository as the "base repository". 

### Step 3: Merge the Pull Request
Once you have created the pull request, you will need to merge it. To do this, go to the pull request page and click the "Merge Pull Request" button. This will merge the changes from the forked repository into the original repository.

### Step 4: Clean Up 
Finally, you will need to clean up the forked repository. To do this, go to the forked repository and delete any branches that are no longer needed. This will ensure that the forked repository is up-to-date with the original repository.
