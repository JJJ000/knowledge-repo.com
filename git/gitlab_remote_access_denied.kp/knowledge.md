[TOC]

`**` Access Denied**

Access denied occurs when a user attempts to access a resource that they are not authorized to access. This can occur when a user attempts to log in to a GitLab repository with incorrect credentials, or when a user attempts to access a repository that they do not have permission to access.

`**` Fatal Authentication**

Fatal authentication occurs when a user attempts to authenticate with a GitLab repository, but the authentication fails. This can occur when a user attempts to log in to a repository with incorrect credentials, or when the authentication process fails for other reasons.

`**` Troubleshooting**

When troubleshooting access denied or fatal authentication errors, the first step is to ensure that the user has the correct credentials. If the credentials are correct, then the user should check the permissions on the repository to ensure that they have the correct access.

`**` Conclusion**

Access denied and fatal authentication errors can be caused by incorrect credentials or insufficient permissions on a repository. Troubleshooting these errors requires verifying the credentials and permissions of the user attempting to access the repository.
