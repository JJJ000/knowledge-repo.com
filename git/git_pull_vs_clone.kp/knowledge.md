### Pull
Pulling is a way of downloading the latest version of a repository from a remote server to the local machine. It is used to synchronize the local repository with the remote repository.

### Clone
Cloning is a way of creating an exact copy of a remote repository on the local machine. It is used to create a local copy of the remote repository and download the entire repository and its history to the local machine.
