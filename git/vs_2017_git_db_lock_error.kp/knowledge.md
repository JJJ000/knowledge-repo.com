# Overview

When using Visual Studio 2017, users may encounter an error when committing changes to a Git repository. The error is “Error encountered while writing to the database: DB.lock”. This error can be caused by several different issues.

# Possible Causes

1. The most common cause of this error is a conflict between the local repository and the remote repository. This can occur when changes have been made to the remote repository and not pulled into the local repository, or when changes have been made to the local repository and not pushed to the remote repository. 

2. Another possible cause is that the Git repository is not configured correctly. This can be caused by incorrect settings or missing files.

3. Finally, it is possible that the local repository is corrupted. This can occur due to a power outage or other system error.

# Solutions

1. To resolve conflicts between the local and remote repositories, the user should first pull the changes from the remote repository into the local repository. Then, the user should resolve any conflicts that arise, commit the changes, and push the changes to the remote repository.

2. To ensure that the Git repository is configured correctly, the user should check the settings and make sure that all necessary files are present.

3. To repair a corrupted local repository, the user should delete the repository and clone it again from the remote repository.
