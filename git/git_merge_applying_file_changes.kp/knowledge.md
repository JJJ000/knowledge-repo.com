#1 Merging the Changes

The first step in applying changes to a file that has been moved to a different location is to merge the changes. This can be done using the `git merge` command. This command allows you to take the changes from one branch and apply them to another. 

#2 Resolving Conflicts

After the merge command is run, conflicts may arise. These conflicts occur when the same line of code has been changed in both branches. When this happens, a manual resolution must be made. This can be done by opening the files and manually editing the code, or using a merge tool such as `git mergetool`.

#3 Committing the Merge

Once the conflicts have been resolved, the changes must be committed. This can be done by running the `git commit` command. This will save the changes and make them part of the new branch.

#4 Pushing the Changes

The last step is to push the changes to the remote repository. This can be done by running the `git push` command. This will update the remote repository with the new changes and make them available to other users.
