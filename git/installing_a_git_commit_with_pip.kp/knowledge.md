[TOC]

# Section 1: Prerequisites

Before attempting to install a specific git commit with pip, it is important to check whether the commit is part of a release. If the commit is part of a release, it can be installed using the standard pip install command.

# Section 2: Downloading the Git Repository

If the commit is not part of a release, the git repository must be downloaded. This can be done using the git clone command.

# Section 3: Installing the Commit

Once the repository is downloaded, the specific commit can be installed using the pip install command. The syntax for this is:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git@<commit>
```

Where <username> is the username of the repository owner, <repository> is the name of the repository, and <commit> is the commit hash.

# Section 4: Testing the Installation

Once the commit is installed, it is important to test the installation to ensure that it is functioning as expected. This can be done by running the unit tests or other tests that are part of the repository.
