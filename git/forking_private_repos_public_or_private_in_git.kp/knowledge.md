**Contents**

[TOC]

### No
Forking someone else's private Github repo into your account will not appear as a public repo. It will remain as a private repo in your account.

### Private repo
When you fork someone else's private repo, it will be added to your account as a private repo. This means that only you and the people you choose to share it with will be able to access it.

### Access
You will be able to access the repo in your account and make changes to it as you see fit. However, you will not be able to make any changes to the original repo.

### Owner
The original owner of the repo will still be the owner of the repo in your account. You will not be able to transfer ownership of the repo to yourself or anyone else.
