### Benefits of Lightweight Tags
Lightweight tags are easier to create and manage than annotated tags. They are also faster to create since they don't require any additional information or message. This makes them ideal for quick tagging of commits.

### Benefits of Annotated Tags
Annotated tags provide more information than lightweight tags. They include a message that can be used to explain the purpose of the tag. This makes them useful for tracking important milestones in a project. Additionally, annotated tags are cryptographically signed which makes them more secure than lightweight tags.

### When to Use Lightweight Tags
Lightweight tags are best used for quickly tagging a commit without needing to provide additional information. They are also useful for generating tags that are easy to read and manage.

### When to Use Annotated Tags
Annotated tags should be used when tracking important milestones in a project or when it is important to provide additional information about the tag. They are also useful when needing to provide a secure tag.
