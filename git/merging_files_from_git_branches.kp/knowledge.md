tldr: To merge specific files from Git branches, use the `git checkout` command to switch to the branch containing the desired files, and then use the `git merge` command to merge the files into the current branch.

### Identify Files to Merge

Before merging files from different branches, you must first identify which files you want to merge. This can be done by viewing the log of each branch to determine which files have changed. You can also use the `git diff` command to compare the differences between the branches.

### Checkout Target Branch

Once you have identified the files you want to merge, you must then checkout the target branch. This can be done by using the `git checkout` command followed by the name of the target branch.

### Merge Files

Once you have checked out the target branch, you can then merge the files by using the `git merge` command followed by the name of the source branch. This will merge the files from the source branch into the target branch.

### Resolve Conflicts

If there are any conflicts between the files, you must then resolve them before the merge can be completed. This can be done by using the `git status` command to list the conflicts, then using the `git add` command to add the files, and finally using the `git commit` command to commit the changes.
