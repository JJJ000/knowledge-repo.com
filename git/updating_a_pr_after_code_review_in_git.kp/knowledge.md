### 1. Making Changes

After receiving feedback from the code review, the first step is to make the necessary changes to the pull request. This can be done by either directly editing the code in the pull request or by committing the changes to the branch associated with the pull request.

### 2. Pushing Changes

Once the changes have been made, it is important to push the changes to the branch associated with the pull request. If the changes have been made directly in the pull request, then it is necessary to commit the changes and push them to the branch.

### 3. Updating the Pull Request

Once the changes have been pushed to the branch, the pull request should be updated to reflect the changes. This can be done by either clicking the “Update” button in the pull request or by clicking the “Add files” button and adding the changed files to the pull request.

### 4. Requesting a Re-Review

Once the pull request has been updated, it is important to request a re-review of the changes. This can be done by either commenting on the pull request or by mentioning the reviewer in the pull request. After the reviewer has reviewed the changes, the pull request can be merged.
