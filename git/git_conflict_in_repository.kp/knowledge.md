`**` What Is Git?**

Git is a distributed version control system used to track changes in source code. It is popular for its speed, data integrity, and distributed nature. It is used by developers to collaborate on software projects.

`**` How Does Git Work?**

Git works by storing snapshots of a projectâ€™s source code in a repository. When a user makes a change to the source code, it is tracked and stored in the repository. This allows users to easily track changes and revert back to previous versions of the code.

`**` What Is a Git Process?**

A Git process is a set of commands and procedures used to manage a repository. These processes are used to add, commit, and push changes to a repository. They also allow users to work together on a project in a collaborative manner.

`**` What Is the Impact of Another Git Process?**

If another Git process is running in the same repository, it can cause conflicts and errors. This is because changes from both processes may not be compatible. To avoid this, it is important to ensure that all users are using the same version of Git and that all processes are running in the same repository.
