### Cloning the Repository

The first step is to clone the GitHub repository to your local machine. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:

`git clone <url>`

Where `<url>` is the URL of the repository you want to clone.

### Fetching Updates

Once the repository is cloned, you can fetch any updates from the remote repository by running the following command:

`git fetch`

This will download any new commits from the remote repository and add them to your local repository.

### Merging Changes

Once the updates have been fetched, you can merge them into your local repository by running the following command:

`git merge`

This will merge any changes from the remote repository into your local repository.

### Pushing Changes

Finally, you can push your local changes back to the remote repository by running the following command:

`git push`

This will upload any changes you have made to the remote repository.
