### Pull Request
A pull request is a method of submitting contributions to an open development project. It is a request for the source code maintainer to pull changes from a local repository into the main repository. Pull requests are used to submit code changes to a project, request a change from another user, or review code changes made by other users.

### Merge Request
A merge request is a request to merge one branch into another. Unlike a pull request, a merge request can be used to merge changes from multiple branches into a single branch. Merge requests are used to review changes from multiple developers, discuss changes, and decide which changes should be accepted or rejected.

### Difference
The main difference between a pull request and a merge request is the scope of the request. A pull request is used to submit code changes to a single branch, while a merge request is used to merge changes from multiple branches into a single branch.
