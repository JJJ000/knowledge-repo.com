### Analyze the Patch

The first step to troubleshooting a patch that does not apply is to analyze it. The patch can be examined to determine if it is the correct patch for the version of the code being patched. Additionally, the patch should be checked for any errors.

### Check the Source Code

The next step is to check the source code to make sure that it matches the patch. If the source code has been modified since the patch was created, the patch may not apply correctly. In this case, the patch may need to be modified to account for the changes in the source code.

### Check the Environment

The environment in which the patch is being applied should be checked to make sure that all the necessary tools and dependencies are installed and configured correctly. This includes making sure that the correct version of Git is installed and that the correct version of the source code is being patched.

### Reapply the Patch

Finally, if all of the above steps have been completed and the patch still does not apply, it may be necessary to reapply the patch. This can be done by running the patch command again and ensuring that the correct parameters are used. If the patch is still not applying, it may be necessary to manually apply the patch or contact the patch author for assistance.
