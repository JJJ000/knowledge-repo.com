### Commit Message

The commit message is a description of the changes made in a commit.

### Format

Commit messages should follow a specific format to ensure that they are easy to read and understand. The format consists of a single-line summary of the changes, followed by a blank line, followed by a more detailed description of the changes.

### Content

Commit messages should include a brief description of the changes, as well as the reasons for making them. If the commit fixes a bug, the message should include a reference to the bug, such as a bug number or URL.

### Examples

Here are some examples of good commit messages:

- Fix bug #123: Fix a bug in the login page
- Add feature X: Add a new feature to the product
- Refactor code: Refactor the code to improve readability and maintainability
