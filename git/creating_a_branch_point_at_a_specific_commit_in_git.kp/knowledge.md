### Step 1: Checkout the Commit

To make a branch point at a specific commit in Git, the first step is to check out the commit. This can be done by using the `git checkout` command followed by the commit hash.

### Step 2: Create the Branch

Once the commit has been checked out, the next step is to create a new branch at that commit. This can be done by using the `git branch` command followed by the name of the new branch.

### Step 3: Checkout the New Branch

The final step is to check out the newly created branch. This can be done by using the `git checkout` command followed by the name of the new branch.

### Step 4: Push the Branch

Once the new branch has been checked out, the final step is to push the branch to the remote repository. This can be done by using the `git push` command followed by the name of the new branch.
