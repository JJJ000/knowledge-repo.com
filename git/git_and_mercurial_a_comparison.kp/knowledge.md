#Differences
Git and Mercurial are both distributed version control systems, but they differ in many ways. 

Git is a more popular and widely used version control system, while Mercurial is less popular and is used mainly by developers who prefer a more lightweight system.

Git is a more complex system than Mercurial, and it has a steep learning curve. Mercurial is simpler and easier to learn.

Git has a larger community and more resources available for support, while Mercurial has a smaller community and fewer resources available.

#Similarities
Both Git and Mercurial are distributed version control systems, which means that users can work on their own copies of the repository and have full control over their own changes.

Both systems also have a branching and merging system that allows users to create separate branches for different versions of the project, and then merge them back together when the changes are complete.

Both systems also have the ability to track changes and provide a history of the project. This allows users to easily go back to previous versions if needed.

Finally, both systems are open source and are available for free.
