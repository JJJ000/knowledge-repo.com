[TOC]

### Forking
Forking is the process of creating a copy of a repository from one user’s account to another. This allows a user to make changes and additions to the repository without affecting the original repository.

### Branching
Branching is the process of creating a new line of development from a specific point in the repository’s history. This allows a user to make changes and additions to the repository without affecting the original repository, but also allows for different versions of the repository to exist.
