1. Install a Merge Tool
First, install a merge tool of your choice. Popular options include Beyond Compare, KDiff3, and P4Merge.

3. Set Paths
Finally, set the paths to the merge tool's executable file and configuration file. This can be done by running the following command in the terminal:

`git config --global mergetool.<name of tool>.path <path to executable>`

`git config --global mergetool.<name of tool>.cmd <configuration file path>`

4. Test Merge Tool
Once the merge tool is installed and configured, you can test it by running the following command in the terminal:
