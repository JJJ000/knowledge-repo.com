#### What is Hash Collision?
A hash collision is when two different files have the same hash value. This means that the same hash value is produced for two different objects.

#### Why is this a Problem in Git?
In Git, hashes are used to identify every file, commit, and other objects in the repository. If two different objects have the same hash value, Git will not be able to differentiate between them and will treat them as the same object. This can lead to data loss or corruption, as the wrong object may be overwritten or deleted.

#### How to Avoid Hash Collision?
Hash collisions can be avoided by using a secure hashing algorithm such as SHA-256. This algorithm is designed to produce unique hashes for different objects, making it much less likely that a hash collision will occur.

#### What to Do if a Hash Collision Occurs?
If a hash collision does occur, it is important to identify the objects that have the same hash value and take steps to ensure that the data is not lost or corrupted. This may involve manually checking the contents of the objects and ensuring that the correct data is preserved.
