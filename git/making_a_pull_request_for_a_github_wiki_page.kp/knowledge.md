# Creating a Pull Request

1. Create a Fork: Before you can make a pull request, you need to create a fork of the repository that contains the page you wish to edit. To do this, click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the repository page.

2. Make Your Changes: After forking the repository, you can make your changes to the page. Make sure to commit your changes to your forked repository.

3. Submit the Pull Request: Once you have committed your changes, you can submit a pull request. To do this, click the "New pull request" button on the repository page and follow the instructions.

4. Wait for Approval: After submitting your pull request, you will need to wait for the repository maintainers to review and approve your changes. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main repository.
