### Using `git show` 

The `git show` command can be used to display the changes made in a particular commit. This command takes the commit hash as an argument and displays the changes made in that commit.

### Using `git log`

The `git log` command can be used to view the details of a particular commit. This command takes the commit hash as an argument and displays the changes made in that commit. This command also displays the author, date, and message associated with the commit.

### Using a Graphical Interface

Many graphical Git clients, such as GitHub Desktop, provide a graphical interface for viewing commits. This interface typically displays the commit message, author, date, and the changes made in the commit.
