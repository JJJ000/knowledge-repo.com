## Git Log
Git log is a command used to view the commit history of a repository. It displays a list of commits that have been made to the repository, along with the author, date, and message associated with each commit.

## Git Reflog
Git reflog is a command used to view the history of changes to a repository's references. It displays a list of commits that have been made to the repository, along with the reference that was changed, the new value of the reference, and the date and time of the change.
