tldr: NoClassDefFoundError is thrown when the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) or a ClassLoader instance tries to load a class, but no definition for the class could be found.

[TOC]

### Causes
NoClassDefFoundError occurs when the JVM looks for a class and doesn't find it. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including:

* The class was not included in the classpath when the application was compiled.
* The class was included in the classpath but was corrupted or deleted.
* The class was present but was not compatible with the version of the JVM.

### Troubleshooting
To troubleshoot a NoClassDefFoundError, the first step is to identify the missing class. This can be done by looking at the stack trace of the error. Once the missing class is identified, the following steps can be taken to resolve the issue:

* Ensure that the class is included in the classpath.
* Check for any corrupt or missing class files.
* Ensure that the class is compatible with the version of the JVM.

### Prevention
To prevent a NoClassDefFoundError from occurring, the following steps should be taken:

* Ensure that all necessary classes are included in the classpath when compiling the application.
* Ensure that all necessary classes are present and not corrupted.
* Ensure that all classes are compatible with the version of the JVM.
