# Section 2: What is Android Tools > Fix Project Properties?
Android Tools > Fix Project Properties is a feature in Android Studio that allows you to quickly update your project properties to match the latest version of the Android SDK. This is especially useful if you have an outdated project that needs to be updated in order to use the latest features of the Android SDK.

# Section 3: What is the Required Compiler Compliance Level for Android?
The required compiler compliance level for Android is 5.0 or 6.0. This means that your code must use language features from Java 5 or 6 in order to be compatible with the Android SDK.

# Section 4: What Should I Do if I Have Found '1.7' Instead?
If you have found '1.7' instead of the required 5.0 or 6.0, then you should use Android Tools > Fix Project Properties to update your project properties to match the latest version of the Android SDK.
