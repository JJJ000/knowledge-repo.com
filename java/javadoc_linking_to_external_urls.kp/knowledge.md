### Syntax

The syntax for linking to an external URL in Javadoc is `{@link <url> <text>}`.

### Example

For example, to link to the Oracle website, the syntax would be `{@link https://www.oracle.com Oracle}`. This would create a link to the Oracle website with the text "Oracle" as the link label.

### Usage

This syntax can be used in Javadoc comments to link to external websites. This can be used to provide additional information or resources to the reader.

### Tips

When linking to an external URL, it is important to make sure that the URL is valid and up-to-date. It is also important to make sure that the link text is descriptive and relevant to the linked URL.
