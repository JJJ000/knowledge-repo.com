tldr: Yes, all classes in a package can be found using reflection in Java by obtaining the Class objects from the Package object.

**Using Reflection**

Reflection is a powerful tool in Java that allows us to inspect and manipulate classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime. With reflection, we can use the `Class` class to get information about a package and its classes.

**Steps**

1. Get the `Package` object for the package that needs to be inspected. This can be done using the `Package.getPackage(String packageName)` method.

2. Get the list of classes in the package using the `Package.getClasses()` method. This will return an array of `Class` objects for all the classes in the package.

3. Iterate through the array of `Class` objects and get the name of each class using the `Class.getName()` method.

**Conclusion**

Using reflection, it is possible to find all classes in a package. The `Package` class provides methods to get the `Package` object for the package and to get the list of classes in the package. Iterating through the array of `Class` objects and getting the name of each class allows us to find all the classes in the package.
