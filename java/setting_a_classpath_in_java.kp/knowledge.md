### What is a Classpath?
A classpath is the path that the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) uses to find classes and other resources on the filesystem. It is a list of directories, JAR files, and ZIP archives that contain class and resource files.

### How to Set a Classpath in Java

### Using the Command Line
The classpath can be set at the command line using the `-cp` or `-classpath` option. For example, to set the classpath to the current directory, use the following command:

`java -cp .`

### Using the CLASSPATH Environment Variable
The classpath can also be set using the CLASSPATH environment variable. To do this, set the CLASSPATH environment variable to the desired classpath. For example, to set the classpath to the current directory, use the following command:

`export CLASSPATH=.`
