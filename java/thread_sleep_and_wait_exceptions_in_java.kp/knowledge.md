tldr: Thread.sleep(x) and wait() can throw InterruptedException if the thread executing them is interrupted.

### Exception

When using Thread.sleep(x) or wait(), Java throws an InterruptedException. This exception is thrown when a thread is interrupted while it is waiting, either for a specified amount of time or until a certain condition is met.

### Causes

The InterruptedException can be caused by a number of different things. If a thread is interrupted while waiting, either by another thread or by an external event, the InterruptedException will be thrown. It can also be thrown if the thread is interrupted while sleeping or waiting for a certain condition to be met.

### Handling

The InterruptedException should be handled properly in order to avoid any unexpected behaviour. The best way to handle this exception is to catch it and then either resume the thread or terminate it.

### Prevention

In order to prevent the InterruptedException from being thrown, the thread should be monitored for any external events that could cause it to be interrupted. Additionally, the thread should be kept alive for as long as it is necessary, and should not be terminated prematurely.
