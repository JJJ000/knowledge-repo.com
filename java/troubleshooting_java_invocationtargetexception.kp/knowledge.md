[TOC]

#1 Incorrectly Formatted Method Calls
Java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException is thrown when a method call is incorrectly formatted or contains invalid arguments. This can occur when the method being called is not compatible with the arguments being passed, or if the wrong number of arguments is being passed.

#2 Security Restrictions
Java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException can also be thrown if a security manager has been set and it blocks the method call due to security restrictions.

#3 Access Control
Java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException can also be thrown if the method being called is not accessible from the current context. This can occur if the method is private or protected, or if the class containing the method is not visible to the current class.

#4 Unchecked Exceptions
Finally, Java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException can be thrown if the method being called throws an unchecked exception. This can occur if the method is not properly handling the exception, or if the code that is calling the method is not properly handling the exception.
