## Section 1: Overview
IntelliJ Starred (Package) Imports is an IntelliJ feature that allows users to quickly import all classes from a package with a single star * character. This feature can be useful for quickly importing multiple classes, but can also lead to bloated code and can make it difficult to identify which classes are being imported.

## Section 2: Disabling IntelliJ Starred Imports
IntelliJ Starred (Package) Imports can be disabled in the IntelliJ settings. To do this, open IntelliJ and go to File > Settings. From there, select Editor > General > Code Completion. Uncheck the box next to “Allow star imports”. This will disable the feature and prevent IntelliJ from automatically importing classes with a star * character.

## Section 3: Alternatives
If you want to quickly import multiple classes, there are alternatives to IntelliJ Starred (Package) Imports. One option is to use the IntelliJ “Optimize Imports” feature. This feature will automatically organize and optimize your imports, making it easier to identify which classes are being imported.

Another option is to use the IntelliJ “Organize Imports” feature. This feature allows you to quickly select multiple classes to import from a package. This can be a more efficient way to import multiple classes without using a star * character.

## Section 4: Conclusion
IntelliJ Starred (Package) Imports can be a useful feature, but can also lead to bloated code and can make it difficult to identify which classes are being imported. To prevent this, IntelliJ Starred (Package) Imports can be disabled in the IntelliJ settings. Additionally, there are alternatives such as the IntelliJ “Optimize Imports” and “Organize Imports” features that can make it easier to quickly import multiple classes.
