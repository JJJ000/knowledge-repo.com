### Advantages 

Double brace initialization is an efficient way to create and initialize an anonymous inner class. This technique is especially useful when the anonymous inner class is used only once. It helps to avoid the creation of unnecessary objects and makes the code more concise.

### Disadvantages

Double brace initialization can cause memory leaks if not used properly. The anonymous inner class created with double brace initialization will have an implicit reference to the enclosing class, which can lead to memory leaks if not managed properly. Additionally, double brace initialization can make the code more difficult to read and debug.

### Performance 

Double brace initialization is an efficient way to create and initialize an anonymous inner class. This technique can help to improve the performance of the application by avoiding the creation of unnecessary objects.

### Limitations

Double brace initialization should be used with caution, as it can cause memory leaks if not managed properly. Additionally, this technique should only be used when the anonymous inner class is used only once, as it can make the code more difficult to read and debug.
