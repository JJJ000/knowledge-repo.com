1. Overview 
Java annotations can be used to provide information about a program, which can then be scanned at runtime. Annotations can be used to define metadata about a class, method, or variable, and can be read and processed at runtime by Java Reflection APIs. This allows developers to create applications that can use this metadata to provide additional functionality.

2. Annotation Basics 
Annotations in Java are defined using the @ symbol, followed by the annotation type. For example, the @Override annotation is used to indicate that a method is overriding a method in a superclass. Annotations can also have parameters, which can be used to provide additional information about the annotation.

3. Using Reflection to Scan Annotations 
Java Reflection APIs can be used to scan for annotations at runtime. The Class class provides methods for retrieving annotations, such as getAnnotations(), getDeclaredAnnotations(), and getAnnotation(). These methods can be used to retrieve annotations from classes, methods, and fields.

4. Benefits of Scanning Annotations 
Scanning annotations at runtime can be beneficial for applications that need to process metadata. For example, an application can use annotations to define configuration information, and then use the Reflection API to read and process the configuration at runtime. This can be used to provide additional features or customize the behavior of the application.
