### Type List
Type List is an interface in the Java Collection Framework. It is a subinterface of the Collection interface. It is used to store a collection of objects. It allows duplicate elements and preserves the insertion order of elements.

### Type ArrayList
Type ArrayList is a class in the Java Collection Framework. It implements the List interface. It is used to store a collection of objects. It allows duplicate elements and preserves the insertion order of elements. It is a dynamic array which can grow and shrink as per the requirement. It provides random access to the elements by using the index. It is not synchronized and hence is not thread-safe.
