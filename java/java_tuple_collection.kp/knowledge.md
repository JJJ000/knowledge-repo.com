#1 Arrays
Arrays are the most basic data structure in Java. They are used to store a collection of elements of the same data type. Arrays are fixed in size, meaning the size of the array cannot be changed after it is initialized.

#2 ArrayLists
ArrayLists are a type of collection class in Java. They are similar to arrays in that they store a collection of elements, but they are not fixed in size. Elements can be added and removed from an ArrayList, and the size of the list will be adjusted accordingly.

#3 HashMaps
HashMaps are another type of collection class in Java. They store a collection of key-value pairs. The key is used to identify the value in the collection. HashMaps are useful for storing data that needs to be accessed quickly.

#4 Tuples
Tuples are a type of collection class in Java. They are similar to HashMaps in that they store a collection of key-value pairs. However, Tuples are immutable, meaning the values in the collection cannot be changed once they have been set. Tuples are useful for storing data that does not need to be changed.
