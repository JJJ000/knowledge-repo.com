### What is the Diamond Operator? 
The diamond operator (<>) is a new syntax feature in Java 7 that allows the developer to replace the type parameters of generic classes when creating objects. It eliminates the need to specify the type parameters explicitly.

### How Does it Work? 
When creating a generic class, the type parameters must be specified. For example, the following code creates a generic List with a type parameter of String: 

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>();
```

With the diamond operator, the type parameter can be omitted: 

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
```

### Advantages 
The diamond operator offers several advantages. It makes code more concise and easier to read. It also reduces the chances of errors due to incorrect type parameters. Additionally, it can be used with anonymous inner classes, which eliminates the need to repeat the type parameters. 

### Disadvantages 
The diamond operator does have some drawbacks. It can lead to ambiguity in some cases, as the compiler cannot infer the type parameters from the context. Additionally, it may be more difficult to debug code that uses the diamond operator, as the type parameters are not explicitly specified.
