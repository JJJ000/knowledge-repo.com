tldr: Illegal key size or default parameters indicate that the cryptographic strength of the security implementation is insufficient.

### Introduction 
Java Security is a set of tools and technologies that protect Java-based applications from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. It includes a variety of security features such as authentication, authorization, encryption, and secure storage. Java Security also includes features that help protect against attacks such as illegal key size or default parameters.

### Illegal Key Size
Illegal key size occurs when an application attempts to use an encryption key that is too short for the encryption algorithm being used. This can lead to weak encryption and make it easier for attackers to guess the key and gain access to the application. To prevent this, applications should use encryption keys that are at least 128-bits long.

### Default Parameters
Default parameters are settings that are used by an application if no other settings are specified. These settings may not be secure and can leave applications vulnerable to attack. To prevent this, applications should use custom settings that are tailored to the application's security requirements.

### Conclusion
Java Security is an important tool for protecting applications from unauthorized access and malicious attacks. It includes features such as authentication, authorization, encryption, and secure storage. Additionally, it includes features that help protect against attacks such as illegal key size or default parameters. By using strong encryption keys and custom security settings, applications can better protect themselves from attack.
