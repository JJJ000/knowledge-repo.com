# Yes

Spring @Transactional attribute does work on a private method in Java. This is because the annotation is processed at runtime by the Spring AOP framework. As long as the method is part of a Spring bean, the annotation will be applied to the method and will be used to control the transactional behavior of the method.

# How

The @Transactional annotation is used to mark a method or class as being transactional. When a method is marked with this annotation, the Spring AOP framework will wrap the method in a transaction. This means that any code within the method will be executed within a transaction, and any changes made to the database will be committed when the method finishes executing.

# Benefits

Using @Transactional on private methods provides several benefits. First, it helps to ensure that the code within the method is executed in an atomic manner, meaning that all of the code must execute successfully in order for the changes to be committed to the database. This helps to ensure that the data remains consistent and that any changes made are not lost.

Second, using @Transactional on private methods helps to reduce the amount of boilerplate code that needs to be written when dealing with transactions. Without the annotation, developers would need to manually create and manage transactions, which can be tedious and error-prone. With the annotation, transactions are automatically managed by the Spring AOP framework, making the code simpler and more maintainable.
