tldr: You can use a JSON to Java Object Mapping library such as Jackson or Gson to generate Java classes from JSON.

## Section 1 - Setting Up the Project

Before you can generate a Java class from a JSON, you need to set up your project. This involves creating a new Java project in your IDE, adding the necessary libraries and dependencies, and setting up the build path. 

## Section 2 - Parsing the JSON

Once the project is set up, you can start parsing the JSON. This involves loading the JSON string into a JSON parser, such as Gson or Jackson, and then converting it into a Java object. This can be done with a few lines of code. 

## Section 3 - Generating the Java Class

Once the JSON is parsed into a Java object, you can generate a Java class from it. This is done by using a code generator, such as Lombok or AutoValue. These tools will generate the Java class based on the JSON object. 

## Section 4 - Compiling the Java Class

Finally, you need to compile the generated Java class. This is done by using the Java compiler, javac. This will compile the generated Java class into a .class file, which can then be used in your project.
