tldr: A try-catch block can be implemented in Java using the try, catch, and finally keywords.

[TOC]

##### Try Block
A try block is used to enclose a set of instructions that may cause an exception. If an exception is thrown, the code in the catch block is executed.

```
try {
    // code that may throw an exception
}
```

##### Catch Block
A catch block is used to handle an exception thrown by the try block. It must be placed immediately after the try block.

```
catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // code to handle the exception
}
```

##### Finally Block
A finally block is used to execute code regardless of whether an exception is thrown or not. It is optional and must be placed immediately after the try or catch block.

```
finally {
    // code that always runs
}
```

##### Retry Block
A retry block is used to retry a set of instructions after an exception is thrown. It must be placed immediately after the catch block.

```
retry {
    // code to retry after an exception
}
```
