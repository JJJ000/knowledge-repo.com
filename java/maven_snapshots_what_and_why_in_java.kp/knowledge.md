### What is a Maven Snapshot?
Maven Snapshot is a versioning scheme used by Maven, a build automation tool used in Java. A snapshot is a version of a project that is not officially released yet. It is a way to share the development version of a project with other developers.

### Why do we need it in Java?
Maven Snapshot is a useful tool in Java development to help ensure that the latest version of a project is always available. It allows developers to easily access the latest version of a project and collaborate on the development of new features and bug fixes. This helps to ensure that the project is always up to date and that any new features are tested and ready for use. Additionally, Maven Snapshot allows developers to easily roll back to a previous version of the project if needed.
