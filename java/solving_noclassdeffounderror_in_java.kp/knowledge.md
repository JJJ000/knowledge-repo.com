# Section 1: Identify the Missing Class
The first step in solving a NoClassDefFoundError is to identify the missing class. The error message will typically indicate the name of the class that could not be found. 

# Section 2: Check the Classpath
The next step is to check the classpath to make sure that the class is in the correct location. The classpath is a list of directories and/or jar files that the JVM will search for classes. If the class is not in the correct location, then the JVM will not be able to find it and the NoClassDefFoundError will be thrown. 

# Section 3: Check for Dependencies
It is also important to check for any dependencies that the missing class may have. If the class is dependent on another class or jar file, then the JVM will not be able to find it and the NoClassDefFoundError will be thrown. 

# Section 4: Check for Compilation Errors
Finally, it is important to check for any compilation errors that may have occurred while compiling the class. If there were any compilation errors, then the class may not have been properly compiled and the JVM will not be able to find it and the NoClassDefFoundError will be thrown.
