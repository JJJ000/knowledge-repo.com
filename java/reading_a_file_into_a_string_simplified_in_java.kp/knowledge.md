# Section 1: Importing Java Libraries

In order to read a file into a String in Java, the following libraries need to be imported:

`import java.io.File;`
`import java.io.IOException;`
`import java.nio.file.Files;`
`import java.nio.file.Paths;`

# Section 2: Defining File Path

The file path needs to be defined in order to read the file into a String. This can be done by creating a `File` object and passing the file path as an argument.

`File file = new File("path/to/file.txt");`

# Section 3: Reading File into String

Once the file path has been defined, the file can be read into a String using the `Files.readString()` method. This method takes the `File` object as an argument and returns the file contents as a String.

`String fileContents = Files.readString(file.toPath());`

# Section 4: Handling Exceptions

The `Files.readString()` method can throw an `IOException`, which needs to be handled in order to prevent the program from crashing. This can be done by wrapping the `Files.readString()` method in a `try-catch` block.

```
try {
    String fileContents = Files.readString(file.toPath());
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.err.println("Error reading file: " + e.getMessage());
}
```
