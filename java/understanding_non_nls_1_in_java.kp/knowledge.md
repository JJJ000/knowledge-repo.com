### Definition

$NON-NLS-1$ is a placeholder used in Java to indicate a non-localized string. It is used to indicate that a particular string should not be translated when the software is localized for different languages.

### Use

$NON-NLS-1$ is used to provide a unique identifier for a particular string so that it can be identified easily when the software is localized. It is also used to indicate that the string should not be translated, as it is already in the language of the software.

### Advantages 

Using $NON-NLS-1$ helps to ensure that strings are not translated incorrectly or inconsistently when the software is localized. It also helps to reduce the amount of time and effort required to localize software by providing a way to quickly identify strings that should not be translated.

### Disadvantages

The main disadvantage of using $NON-NLS-1$ is that it can be difficult to remember which strings should not be translated and which should be. It can also be difficult to keep track of which strings have been marked as non-localized and which have not.
