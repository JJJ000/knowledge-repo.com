[TOC]

### JDK
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.

### JRE
The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine which executes Java programs. It includes a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), class libraries, and other files that support the execution of programs written in the Java programming language.

### Difference 
The JDK includes the JRE, but the JRE does not include the development tools (such as compilers and debuggers) necessary for developing applets and applications. The JDK is for developing Java programs, while the JRE is for running them.
