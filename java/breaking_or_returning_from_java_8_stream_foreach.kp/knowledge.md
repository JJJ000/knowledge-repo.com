### Break

The break statement can be used to terminate the loop prematurely when a certain condition is met. It can be used in a forEach loop to break out of the loop when the condition is met.

### Return

The return statement can be used to return a value from the loop. It can be used in a forEach loop to return a value when the condition is met. The return statement will cause the loop to terminate and the value will be returned.
