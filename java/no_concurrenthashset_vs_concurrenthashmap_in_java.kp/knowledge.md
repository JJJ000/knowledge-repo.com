tldr: A Set is a Collection of unique elements, and a Map is a Collection of key-value pairs, so a ConcurrentHashSet is not necessary since a ConcurrentHashMap can provide the same functionality.

### Introduction

ConcurrentHashSet is a set data structure that is thread-safe and allows multiple threads to access and modify the set concurrently. It is similar to the ConcurrentHashMap, which is a map data structure that is thread-safe and allows multiple threads to access and modify the map concurrently. 

### Difference between ConcurrentHashSet and ConcurrentHashMap

The main difference between ConcurrentHashSet and ConcurrentHashMap is that ConcurrentHashSet is a set, while ConcurrentHashMap is a map. A set is a collection of elements that does not contain any duplicate elements and does not have any specific order, while a map is a collection of elements that contains key-value pairs and is ordered by the keys. 

### Why there is no ConcurrentHashSet

There is no ConcurrentHashSet because it is not necessary. The ConcurrentHashMap can be used to achieve the same functionality as a ConcurrentHashSet. The ConcurrentHashMap can be used to store the elements of a set, and each element can be used as the key in the map, with the value being a dummy value (such as null). This way, the ConcurrentHashMap can be used to achieve the same thread-safety and concurrency as a ConcurrentHashSet.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, there is no ConcurrentHashSet because it is not necessary. The ConcurrentHashMap can be used to achieve the same functionality as a ConcurrentHashSet.
