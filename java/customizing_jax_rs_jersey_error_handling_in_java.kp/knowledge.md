# Section 1: Overview

AJAX-RS (also known as JAX-RS) is a Java API for developing web services. It is a part of the Java EE platform and provides a simple yet powerful framework for creating RESTful web services. Jersey is the reference implementation of JAX-RS. It is an open source framework for developing RESTful web services in Java.

# Section 2: Customizing Error Handling

Error handling is an important part of developing any web service. It allows developers to gracefully handle errors and provide meaningful error responses to the client. Jersey provides several ways to customize error handling.

# Section 3: Exception Mappers

An Exception Mapper is a class that implements the javax.ws.rs.ext.ExceptionMapper interface. This interface provides a single method, toResponse(), which is called when an exception is thrown. The toResponse() method allows developers to create a custom response to the client based on the exception that was thrown.

# Section 4: Response Filters

A Response Filter is a class that implements the javax.ws.rs.container.ContainerResponseFilter interface. This interface provides a single method, filter(), which is called before the response is sent back to the client. The filter() method allows developers to modify the response before it is sent back to the client. This is useful for adding custom headers or performing other modifications to the response.
