tldr: The Java application is using more memory than the system is able to provide, resulting in an OutOfMemoryError.

### Solution

### Overview
Java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded is an error thrown when the garbage collector is unable to make any more progress because it has exceeded the maximum garbage collection time limit. This error can occur when the application is using too much memory, or when the garbage collector is unable to reclaim memory in a timely manner.

### Causes
This error can be caused by a number of factors, including:
- Memory leaks
- Insufficient heap size
- Poorly written code
- Excessive garbage collection

### Symptoms
The symptoms of this error include:
- Application performance degradation
- Increased memory usage
- Long garbage collection pauses
- OutOfMemoryError messages in the logs

### Solutions
To address this error, the following solutions can be implemented:
- Increase the heap size
- Identify and address memory leaks
- Optimize the garbage collection process
- Rewrite poorly written code
- Reduce the amount of memory used by the application
