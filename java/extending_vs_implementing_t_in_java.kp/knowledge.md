tldr: In Java, classes can only extend one other class, but can implement multiple interfaces.

### Introduction

In Java, the keyword "extends" is used to indicate that a class is inheriting from another class, while the keyword "implements" is used to indicate that a class is implementing an interface. While both of these keywords are used to indicate a relationship between two classes, they are used for different purposes.

### Extends

The keyword "extends" is used to indicate that a class is inheriting from another class. This means that the class being inherited from is the parent class, and the class that is inheriting is the child class. The child class will have access to all of the methods and fields of the parent class.

### Implements

The keyword "implements" is used to indicate that a class is implementing an interface. An interface is a set of methods that must be implemented by any class that implements it. A class can implement multiple interfaces, and all of the methods in the interface must be implemented by the class.

### Conclusion

In summary, "extends" is used to indicate that a class is inheriting from another class, while "implements" is used to indicate that a class is implementing an interface. While both of these keywords are used to indicate a relationship between two classes, they are used for different purposes.
