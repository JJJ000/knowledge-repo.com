1. ## What is a Global Variable?
A global variable is a variable that can be accessed from any part of the program at any time. It is typically declared outside of any function or class and can be used in any function or class.

2. ## Advantages of Global Variables
- Global variables are easy to use and can be accessed from any part of the program.
- Global variables provide a way to share data between different parts of the program.
- Global variables can be used to store data that needs to be accessed by multiple functions or classes.

3. ## Disadvantages of Global Variables
- Global variables can lead to code that is difficult to debug and maintain.
- Global variables can cause unexpected behavior if they are modified by different parts of the program.
- Global variables can lead to naming conflicts if they are used in multiple parts of the program.

4. ## How to Use Global Variables in Java
In Java, global variables are declared outside of any function or class. They can be accessed from any part of the program by using the fully qualified name of the variable. For example, if a global variable is declared in a class called MyClass, it can be accessed by using the fully qualified name MyClass.myGlobalVariable.
