# Section 1: Understanding Sets
Sets are a collection of elements that are unordered and contain no duplicate elements. A set can contain elements of any type and can be used to store and manipulate data.

# Section 2: Difference between Sets
The difference between two sets is the set of elements that are in one set but not in the other. The difference between two sets can be calculated in two ways: symmetric difference and asymmetric difference.

# Section 3: Calculating Difference in Java
In Java, the difference between two sets can be calculated using the ‘removeAll’ method. This method takes in two sets as parameters and returns a set that contains all the elements that are in the first set but not in the second.

# Section 4: Example
For example, if we have two sets A and B, the difference between them can be calculated as follows:

Set<Integer> A = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5));

Set<Integer> B = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(3, 4, 5, 6, 7));

Set<Integer> difference = new HashSet<>(A);
difference.removeAll(B);

// difference will be {1, 2}
