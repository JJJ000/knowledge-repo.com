tldr: Ensure that the class being serialized has the appropriate Jackson annotations.

`**` Understanding the Problem**

When attempting to serialize an object using the Jackson library in Java, an error is often encountered that reads "No serializer found". This error occurs when the Jackson library is unable to find a serializer that can be used to convert the object into JSON. This can happen when the object contains fields that are not supported by the Jackson library, or if the object is not properly annotated for serialization.

`**` Annotating the Object**

In order to properly serialize an object with the Jackson library, the object must be properly annotated. This can be done by adding the @JsonProperty annotation to each field of the object that needs to be serialized. This annotation tells the Jackson library which fields of the object should be serialized and how they should be serialized.

`**` Handling Unsupported Fields**

If the object contains fields that are not supported by the Jackson library, then it is necessary to create a custom serializer for those fields. This can be done by creating a class that implements the JsonSerializer interface and overriding the serialize() method. This method can then be used to serialize the unsupported fields.

`**` Testing the Serialization**

Once the object has been properly annotated and any unsupported fields have been handled, it is important to test the serialization. This can be done by using the ObjectMapper class to serialize the object and then checking the output to make sure that it is in the correct format. If the output is not in the correct format, then it is necessary to go back and make sure that the object has been properly annotated and that any unsupported fields have been handled.
