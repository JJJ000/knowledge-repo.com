tldr: Exceptions thrown by tasks submitted to an ExecutorService should be handled using a try/catch block within the task itself.

# Section 1: Handle Exceptions in the Task

When using an ExecutorService, it is important to ensure that any exceptions thrown in the task are handled properly. This can be done by using a try-catch block, or by adding a custom exception handler to the task.

# Section 2: Handle Exceptions in the ExecutorService

The ExecutorService can also be configured to handle exceptions thrown by tasks. This can be done by setting an exception handler in the ExecutorService, or by using a custom ThreadFactory that wraps the task in a try-catch block.

# Section 3: Logging

It is important to log any exceptions that occur in the ExecutorService, so that the cause of the exception can be identified and addressed. This can be done by setting a logging handler in the ExecutorService, or by adding a logging statement in the task.

# Section 4: Shutdown Hooks

Finally, it is important to ensure that the ExecutorService is properly shutdown when exceptions occur. This can be done by setting a shutdown hook in the ExecutorService, or by using a custom ThreadFactory that wraps the task in a shutdown hook.
