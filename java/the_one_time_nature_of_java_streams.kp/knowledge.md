tldr: Java Streams are once-off because they are designed to be used only once and cannot be reused.

# Definition of Java Streams
Java Streams are a part of the Java 8 API that allow developers to process data in a declarative manner. Streams are a sequence of elements from a source that supports aggregate operations. These operations are performed on the elements in the stream, such as filtering, mapping, and reducing.

# Reason for Being Once-Off
The main reason Java Streams are once-off is due to the fact that they are designed to be used in a functional programming style. This means that the same input will always produce the same output. As such, it is not possible to modify the data in the stream once it has been created. This is why Java Streams are considered to be "immutable".

# Benefits of Being Once-Off
One of the main benefits of Java Streams being once-off is that it makes them more efficient. As the data in the stream cannot be modified, the stream does not need to be re-evaluated each time a change is made. This makes the stream faster and more efficient. Additionally, it also makes it easier to debug code that uses streams as the data is always consistent.

# Conclusion
Java Streams are once-off due to their design for functional programming. This makes them more efficient and easier to debug. Ultimately, this makes Java Streams an invaluable tool for developers when it comes to processing data.
