### Answer

### Comparison
In Java, you can compare BigDecimal values using the compareTo() method. This method returns an integer value which is:
- less than 0 if the BigDecimal is less than the value being compared to
- equal to 0 if the BigDecimal is equal to the value being compared to
- greater than 0 if the BigDecimal is greater than the value being compared to

### Checking for Greater Than Zero
To check if a BigDecimal is greater than zero, you can use the compareTo() method to compare the BigDecimal to the value 0. 

### Example
For example, if you have a BigDecimal variable called "myBigDecimal" with a value of 5.00, you can check if the BigDecimal is greater than zero like this:

```java
if (myBigDecimal.compareTo(BigDecimal.ZERO) > 0) {
    // myBigDecimal is greater than zero
}
```

### Conclusion
In conclusion, you can compare a BigDecimal value to zero in Java using the compareTo() method to check if the BigDecimal is greater than zero.
