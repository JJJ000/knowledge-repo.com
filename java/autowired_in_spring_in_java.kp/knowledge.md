### Introduction

@Autowired is an annotation used in Spring Framework to inject beans automatically into the application context. It is used to inject dependencies into a class. It is used to reduce the amount of code needed to wire up objects in an application.

### Usage

@Autowired can be used on fields, setter methods and constructors. When using @Autowired on fields, the bean is automatically injected into the field. When using @Autowired on setter methods, the bean is injected when the setter method is called. When using @Autowired on constructors, the bean is injected when the class is instantiated.

### Benefits

The main benefit of using @Autowired is that it reduces the amount of code needed to wire up objects in an application. This makes it easier to maintain and update the code. It also makes the code more readable, as it is easier to understand what is being injected into a class.

### Limitations

One limitation of using @Autowired is that it can be difficult to debug when something goes wrong. If the wrong bean is injected into a class, it can be difficult to determine what went wrong. It is also important to ensure that all the beans that are being injected into a class are available in the application context. If a bean is not available, the application will not work as expected.
