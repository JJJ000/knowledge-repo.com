### Size of Primitive Data Types

The size of primitive data types (e.g. int, char, double, etc.) can be determined using the Java keyword `sizeof()`. This keyword returns the number of bytes occupied by the primitive data type.

### Size of Reference Types

The size of reference types (e.g. objects, arrays, strings, etc.) can be determined using the Java Reflection API. This API provides methods to get the size of an object and its fields.

### Size of Arrays

The size of an array can be determined using the `length` field of the array. This field returns the number of elements in the array.

### Size of Collections

The size of collections (e.g. List, Set, Map, etc.) can be determined using the `size()` method of the collection. This method returns the number of elements in the collection.
