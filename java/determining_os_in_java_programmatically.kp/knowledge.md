tldr: You can use the System.getProperty(`os.name`) method to programmatically determine the operating system in Java.

[TOC]

1. **Using System Properties**

Using the `System.getProperty()` method, you can retrieve the name of the operating system that the Java program is running on. The following code will return the name of the operating system:

```
String osName = System.getProperty("os.name");
```

2. **Using RuntimeMXBean**

Another way to determine the operating system in Java is to use the `RuntimeMXBean` class. This class provides information about the runtime of the Java virtual machine. To get the name of the operating system, you can use the following code:

```
RuntimeMXBean runtimeMxBean = ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean();
String osName = runtimeMxBean.getName();
```

3. **Using System Environment Variables**

You can also use system environment variables to determine the operating system in Java. To get the name of the operating system, you can use the following code:

```
String osName = System.getenv("OS");
```

4. **Using OperatingSystemMXBean**

The `OperatingSystemMXBean` class provides information about the operating system on which the Java virtual machine is running. To get the name of the operating system, you can use the following code:

```
OperatingSystemMXBean operatingSystemMXBean = ManagementFactory.getOperatingSystemMXBean();
String osName = operatingSystemMXBean.getName();
```
