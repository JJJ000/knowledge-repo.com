[TOC]

# Section 1: Creating a Class<T>

Class<T> is a generic type in Java that allows a class to accept any type of object as a parameter. To create a Class<T>, simply declare the class with the generic type parameter T. For example, to create a Class<T> called MyClass, the code would be written as follows:

```
public class MyClass<T> {
    //class code here
}
```

# Section 2: Using Class<T>

Class<T> is used to create a generic class that can accept any type of object as a parameter. This allows the class to be used with different types of objects, making it more flexible and reusable. For example, if you wanted to create a generic method that could accept any type of object, you could use Class<T> to create the method:

```
public <T> void myMethod(T obj) {
    //method code here
}
```

# Section 3: Type Parameters

Class<T> uses type parameters to specify the type of object that can be accepted as a parameter. For example, if you wanted to create a Class<T> that could only accept String objects, you would use the type parameter String:

```
public class MyClass<String> {
    //class code here
}
```

# Section 4: Wildcard Parameters

Class<T> also supports wildcard parameters, which allow any type of object to be accepted as a parameter. This is useful for creating generic methods that can accept any type of object. For example, if you wanted to create a generic method that could accept any type of object, you could use a wildcard parameter:

```
public void myMethod(? obj) {
    //method code here
}
```
