#AWT

AWT stands for Abstract Window Toolkit. It is a set of graphical user interface (GUI) components for Java that are used to create a graphical user interface for Java programs. AWT components are platform-dependent, meaning that they are specific to the operating system on which they are running.

#Swing

Swing is a set of GUI components for Java that is used to create a graphical user interface for Java programs. Swing components are platform-independent, meaning that they can be used on any operating system. Swing components are written in Java, whereas AWT components are written in native code. Swing components are more flexible and customizable than AWT components, and they offer more features and better performance.
