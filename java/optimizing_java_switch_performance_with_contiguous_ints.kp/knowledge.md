tldr: Adding more cases to the switch statement allows the compiler to optimize the code, which can lead to faster execution.

# Section 1

The switch statement in Java is optimized for use with primitive data types such as ints. The switch statement works by creating a lookup table for the cases provided, which provides a faster way to find the right case than a series of if-else statements.

# Section 2

When more cases are added to the switch statement, the lookup table is expanded, which allows the switch statement to find the right case more quickly. This is because the switch statement can quickly look up the value it is searching for in the lookup table, rather than having to check each case one by one.

# Section 3

Adding more cases to the switch statement also reduces the size of the lookup table, which makes it easier for the switch statement to find the right case. This is because the lookup table is smaller and the switch statement can quickly look up the value it is searching for in the lookup table, rather than having to check each case one by one.

# Section 4

Additionally, adding more cases to the switch statement can help to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written. This is because the switch statement can be used to replace multiple if-else statements, which can help to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written and make the code more efficient.
