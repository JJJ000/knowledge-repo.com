### Use Dependency Injection Frameworks

Using a dependency injection framework like Spring or Guice can help to reduce the amount of code needed to inject dependencies. These frameworks provide a way to specify the dependencies in a single configuration file, and then inject them into the classes that need them. This makes the code much more manageable and easier to maintain.

### Use Abstract Factories

Abstract factories are a design pattern that can be used to create objects that have dependencies. The factory can be used to inject the dependencies into the objects, making the code more maintainable and reducing the amount of code needed to inject dependencies.

### Use Factory Classes

Factory classes can be used to create objects that have dependencies. The factory class can be used to inject the dependencies into the objects, making the code more maintainable and reducing the amount of code needed to inject dependencies.

### Use Dependency Injection Containers

Dependency injection containers can be used to manage the dependencies of an application. The container will allow you to specify the dependencies in a single configuration file, and then inject them into the classes that need them. This makes the code much more manageable and easier to maintain.
