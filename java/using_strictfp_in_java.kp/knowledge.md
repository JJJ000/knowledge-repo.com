## What is "strictfp"? 
"strictfp" is a keyword in Java that restricts the floating-point calculations to ensure portability across different platforms. It ensures that the same result is produced on every platform by constraining intermediate values to the precision of the IEEE 754 standard.

## When to Use "strictfp"?
"strictfp" should be used when precise results are needed across different platforms. This keyword is especially important for programs that use floating-point calculations that need to be portable. Examples of such programs include scientific and financial applications, where accuracy is essential.

## Advantages of Using "strictfp"
Using "strictfp" ensures that the same result is produced on every platform. This eliminates the need for manual testing and debugging on different platforms. Additionally, it eliminates the need for platform-specific code to ensure portability.

## Disadvantages of Using "strictfp"
Using "strictfp" can reduce the performance of a program, as the calculations are constrained to the precision of the IEEE 754 standard. This can lead to longer execution times and higher memory usage. Additionally, it can also reduce the accuracy of the calculations, as intermediate values may be rounded off.
