tldr: You may need to manually define a @SpringBootTest annotation on the test class to enable Spring Boot support for JpaTest.

[TOC]

**Section 1: What is a @SpringBootConfiguration?**

A @SpringBootConfiguration is an annotation used in Spring Boot applications. It is used to indicate the class that defines the Spring Boot configuration of the application. This class is typically used to configure beans, set up the application context, and configure the application environment.

**Section 2: Why is it necessary for a JpaTest?**

A JpaTest is a type of test used to test the functionality of a JPA (Java Persistence API) application. In order to properly test the application, it is necessary to have a @SpringBootConfiguration in place. This configuration provides the necessary beans and context needed to properly test the application.

**Section 3: How to Find a @SpringBootConfiguration**

The @SpringBootConfiguration annotation can be found in the main application class of the Spring Boot application. This class is typically located in the `src/main/java` directory.

**Section 4: What to Do If Unable to Find a @SpringBootConfiguration**

If a @SpringBootConfiguration cannot be found, then it is necessary to create one. This can be done by creating a new class with the @SpringBootConfiguration annotation. This class can then be used to configure the beans and context required for the JpaTest.
