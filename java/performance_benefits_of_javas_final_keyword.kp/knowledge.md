### No

The use of the `final` keyword in Java does not improve performance. The keyword is used to indicate that a variable, method, or class cannot be changed, which can help prevent errors. However, it does not affect the runtime performance of the program.

### Compiler Optimizations

Compilers use the `final` keyword to optimize code, which can improve performance. For example, the compiler may be able to inline a method if it is marked as `final` since it knows that it cannot be changed. However, this optimization is not guaranteed and is highly dependent on the compiler and the code being compiled.

### Memory Usage

The use of the `final` keyword can also reduce memory usage. This is because the compiler can make assumptions about the values of `final` variables, which allows it to optimize memory usage. However, this optimization is not guaranteed and is highly dependent on the compiler and the code being compiled.
