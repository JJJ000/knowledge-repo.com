### Anonymous Inner Classes
Anonymous inner classes are a convenient way to create a class without having to define a new type. This class can be used to implement an interface, extend a class, or even create a new class from scratch. Anonymous inner classes are often used as a substitute for function pointers in Java. 

### Lambda Expressions
Lambda expressions are a feature of the Java language that enables the creation of anonymous functions. They are similar to anonymous inner classes in that they provide a way to create a class without having to define a new type. However, lambda expressions are more concise and can be used to create a single method interface. This makes them a great substitute for function pointers in Java. 

### Method References
Method references are a feature of the Java language that allow you to refer to a method without having to explicitly define a new one. This makes them a great substitute for function pointers in Java. They are especially useful when you want to refer to a method in a class that you don’t have access to. 

### Method Handles
Method handles are a feature of the Java language that allow you to refer to a method without having to explicitly define a new one. This makes them a great substitute for function pointers in Java. They are especially useful when you want to refer to a method in a class that you don’t have access to.
