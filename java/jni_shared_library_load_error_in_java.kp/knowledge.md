### What is JNI

Java Native Interface (JNI) is a mechanism that allows Java code running in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to call and be called by native applications and libraries written in other languages such as C, C++ and assembly. It provides a way for the bytecode that Android compiles from managed code written in the Java language to interact with native code written in other languages.

### Causes of Failed to Load JNI

There are several possible causes for a failed JNI load. These include: 

- Incorrectly configured JVM
- Incorrectly configured classpath
- Missing native libraries
- Incorrectly configured native library paths
- Incorrectly specified JNI function names
- Incorrectly specified JNI function signatures

### Troubleshooting Failed to Load JNI

When troubleshooting a failed JNI load, it is important to first identify the cause of the problem. The following steps can be used to help identify the cause of the issue: 

- Check the JVM configuration to ensure that it is correctly configured.
- Check the classpath to ensure that all required classes are present and accessible.
- Check the native library paths to ensure that all required native libraries are present and accessible.
- Check the JNI function names and signatures to ensure that they are correctly specified.
- Check the JNI headers to ensure that they are correctly specified.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, a failed JNI load can be caused by a number of different issues. By following the steps outlined above it is possible to identify the cause of the issue and take the necessary steps to resolve it.
