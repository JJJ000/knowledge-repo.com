# Solution

## 1. Check the Repository

The first step to solving this issue is to check the repository that is being autowired. Make sure it is correctly annotated with `@Repository` and that it is correctly configured in the application context.

## 2. Check the Bean Definition

The second step is to check the bean definition for the repository. Make sure that the bean definition is correctly defined in the application context and that it is correctly configured with the correct scope.

## 3. Check the Dependency Injection

The third step is to check the dependency injection for the repository. Make sure that the correct autowired repository is being injected into the class.

## 4. Check the Classpath

The fourth step is to check the classpath for the repository. Make sure that the repository is being correctly included in the classpath and that it is being correctly loaded.
