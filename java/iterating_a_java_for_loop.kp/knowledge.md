tldr: You can use the `continue` keyword to go to the next iteration in a for loop in Java.

# Using Break

The break statement is used to break out of a loop early. It can be used to end a for loop prematurely when a certain condition is met. When the break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.

# Using Continue

The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and continue with the next iteration. This statement is commonly used when you want to skip certain iterations of a loop based on certain conditions. When the continue statement is encountered inside a loop, the program control immediately jumps to the beginning of the loop for the next iteration, skipping any code in between.

# Using Labels

Labels are used to identify a specific loop in a program. They are used in conjunction with the break and continue statements to control the flow of a loop. A label is an identifier followed by a colon that is applied to a loop. When a break or continue statement is encountered inside a loop, the program control jumps to the label specified in the statement.

# Using Return

The return statement is used to exit from a method and return a value to the caller of the method. It can also be used to exit from a loop prematurely when a certain condition is met. When the return statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.
