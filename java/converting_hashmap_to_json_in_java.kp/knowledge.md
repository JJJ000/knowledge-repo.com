1. **Creating the Hashmap**
The first step is to create the Hashmap. This can be done by declaring a Hashmap with a key and value type. For example: 
```java
HashMap<String, Object> map = new HashMap<String, Object>();
```

2. **Adding Values to the Hashmap**
Once the Hashmap has been declared, values can be added to it. This can be done by using the put() method. For example:
```java
map.put("name", "John Doe");
map.put("age", 25);
```

3. **Converting the Hashmap to a JSON Object**
Once the Hashmap is populated with values, it can be converted to a JSON Object by using the Gson library. The Gson library can be imported by adding the following line to the imports section of the code:
```java
import com.google.gson.Gson;
```
The Gson library can then be used to convert the Hashmap to a JSON Object. This can be done by using the toJson() method. For example:
```java
Gson gson = new Gson();
String json = gson.toJson(map);
```

4. **Printing the JSON Object**
The final step is to print the JSON Object. This can be done by using the println() method. For example:
```java
System.out.println(json);
```
This will print the JSON Object to the console.
