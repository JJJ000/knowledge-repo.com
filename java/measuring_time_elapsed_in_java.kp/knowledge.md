tldr: You can measure time elapsed in Java by using the System.nanoTime() method.

1. Using System.nanoTime():
   System.nanoTime() returns the current value of the most precise available system timer, in nanoseconds. It can be used to measure elapsed time by taking two snapshots of the time, one at the start of the operation and one at the end, and then subtracting the first from the second.

2. Using System.currentTimeMillis():
   System.currentTimeMillis() returns the current time in milliseconds. It can be used to measure elapsed time by taking two snapshots of the time, one at the start of the operation and one at the end, and then subtracting the first from the second.

3. Using Java 8's Instant Class:
   The Instant class in the Java 8 Date/Time API provides a convenient way to measure elapsed time. It can be used to measure elapsed time by taking two snapshots of the time, one at the start of the operation and one at the end, and then subtracting the first from the second.

4. Using Java 8's Duration Class:
   The Duration class in the Java 8 Date/Time API provides a convenient way to measure elapsed time. It can be used to measure elapsed time by taking two snapshots of the time, one at the start of the operation and one at the end, and then subtracting the first from the second.
