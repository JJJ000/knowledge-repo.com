##No Automatic Highlighting
Eclipse does not automatically highlight matching variables in Java. This means that, when writing code, the user must manually search for the corresponding variable names that are used in the code.

##Manual Search
To manually search for a variable, the user must navigate to the variable declaration and look for the variable name. This can be done by using the "Find" feature in Eclipse and typing in the variable name.

##Other Options
There are other options available for automatically highlighting matching variables in Java. For example, the Eclipse plugin "Mylyn" provides an automated way to highlight matching variables. Additionally, the "FindBugs" plugin can be used to detect potential errors in code related to variable names.

##Conclusion
In conclusion, Eclipse does not automatically highlight matching variables in Java. However, there are other options available for users who want to automatically highlight matching variables in their code.
