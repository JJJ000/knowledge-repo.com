### Using the parseInt() Method

The parseInt() method is a static method of the Java Integer class. It can be used to determine if a String is an integer. It takes a String argument and returns an integer value if the argument is a valid integer. If the argument is not a valid integer, it will return a NumberFormatException.

### Using the isDigit() Method

The isDigit() method is a static method of the Java Character class. It can be used to determine if a character is a digit. This method takes a single character argument and returns a boolean value. If the argument is a digit, the method returns true. If the argument is not a digit, the method returns false.

### Using the matches() Method

The matches() method is a static method of the Java String class. It can be used to determine if a String is an integer. It takes a regular expression argument and returns a boolean value. If the argument matches the regular expression, the method returns true. If the argument does not match the regular expression, the method returns false.

### Using the try-catch Block

The try-catch block is a control structure in Java. It can be used to determine if a String is an integer. The try block contains the code that is to be tested for potential errors. The catch block contains the code that is executed if an error occurs. If the code in the try block is successful, the catch block is not executed. If the code in the try block throws an exception, the catch block is executed.
