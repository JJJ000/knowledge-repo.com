# Introduction

The `lintVitalRelease` error occurs when a developer attempts to generate a signed APK using the Gradle build system in Java. This error is caused by a missing lint configuration in the Gradle build file.

# Cause

The `lintVitalRelease` error is caused by a missing lint configuration in the Gradle build file. The lint configuration is used to analyze the code and detect potential problems with the code, such as coding style violations, unused resources, and other potential issues. Without the lint configuration, Gradle will not be able to generate a signed APK.

# Solution

The solution to this error is to add the lint configuration to the Gradle build file. The lint configuration should include the following code:

```
android {
    lintOptions {
        checkReleaseBuilds false
        // Or, if you prefer, you can run checks for all build types
        checkAllWarnings false
    }
}
```

Once the lint configuration is added to the Gradle build file, the developer should be able to generate a signed APK without any errors.

# Conclusion

The `lintVitalRelease` error is caused by a missing lint configuration in the Gradle build file. The solution to this error is to add the lint configuration to the Gradle build file. Once the lint configuration is added, the developer should be able to generate a signed APK without any errors.
