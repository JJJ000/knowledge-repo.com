tldr: You can use a Log4jAppender to capture the log messages and then use JUnit`s assert methods to verify the content of the log messages.

# Section 1: Setting up Logging

In order to do a JUnit assert on a message in a logger, the first step is to set up logging. This can be done by creating a Logger instance and configuring it according to the desired logging behavior.

# Section 2: Writing Logging Statements

After the logger has been configured, the next step is to write the logging statements that will be tested. These statements should be written in such a way that they will produce the desired output when executed.

# Section 3: Writing JUnit Asserts

The next step is to write JUnit asserts that will check the output of the logging statements. This can be done by using the assertEquals() method to compare the expected output with the actual output.

# Section 4: Running the Tests

Finally, the tests should be run in order to make sure that the logging statements and JUnit asserts are working as expected. If any errors or failures are encountered, they should be addressed before the tests can be considered complete.
