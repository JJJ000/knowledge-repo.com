1. #ifdef/#endif
The `#ifdef` and `#endif` preprocessor directives can be used to define a region in Java. This is a common way to separate code into logical sections. This can be used to define a region for a specific set of code, such as a class or method.

2. Comments
Comments can be used to define a region in Java. This is the simplest way to define a region in Java, as it requires no additional code. Comments can be used to add additional information about the code, such as a description of the purpose of the region.

3. Annotations
Annotations can be used to define a region in Java. Annotations are used to add additional information about the code, such as a description of the purpose of the region.

4. Code Folding
Code folding can be used to define a region in Java. This is a feature in many code editors that allows the user to collapse a section of code, making it easier to read. This can be used to define a region for a specific set of code, such as a class or method.
