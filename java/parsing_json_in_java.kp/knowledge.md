### Using a JSON Library

The simplest way to parse JSON in Java is by using a JSON library. These libraries provide a set of classes and methods that allow developers to easily parse and manipulate JSON data. Popular libraries for parsing JSON in Java include Jackson, Gson, and org.json.

### Using the JSONObject Class

The JSONObject class is part of the org.json library and provides a way to parse and manipulate JSON data without using a library. The JSONObject class provides methods for parsing and manipulating JSON data, such as get(), put(), and opt().

### Using the JSONParser Class

The JSONParser class is part of the `org.json` library and provides a way to parse JSON data without using a library. The JSONParser class provides methods for parsing JSON data, such as parse(), parseObject(), and parseArray().

### Using the Java Stream API

The Java Stream API can be used to parse JSON data without using a library. The Stream API provides a way to process data in a declarative way, making it easier to read and understand. The Stream API provides methods for parsing and manipulating JSON data, such as map(), flatMap(), and filter().
