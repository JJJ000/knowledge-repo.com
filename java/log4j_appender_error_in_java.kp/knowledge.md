### Explanation
When configuring log4j, the logger is the component used to log messages to the various appenders. If no appenders are specified for a logger, then no messages will be logged.

### Causes
The most common cause of no appenders being found for a logger is a misconfigured log4j.xml or log4j.properties file. This can happen if the file is not properly configured or if the file is not in the correct location.

### Troubleshooting
To troubleshoot this issue, first check the configuration file to make sure it is properly configured. If the file is in the correct location, then it may be necessary to check the log4j documentation to determine the correct syntax for the configuration file.

### Solution
Once the configuration file is properly configured, the logger should be able to find the appenders and log messages accordingly.
