tldr: Static classes cannot be instantiated, and therefore cannot be declared in Java.

1. Static Classes are Not Allowed
----------
In Java, the static keyword can be used to create class variables and class methods, but it cannot be used to declare a class. A class is a template used to create objects, and the static keyword can only be used to refer to class members that are shared by all objects of a class.

2. Static Classes Are Not Needed
----------
In Java, classes are already implicitly static. When a class is declared, it is already available to all objects that are created from it. Therefore, there is no need to declare a class as static.

3. Static Classes Are Not Possible
----------
In Java, classes cannot be declared as static because they are part of the object-oriented programming paradigm. Object-oriented programming is based on the concept of objects, which are created from classes. Therefore, a class cannot be declared as static because it cannot exist without objects.

4. Static Classes Are Not Recommended
----------
Although it is not possible to declare a class as static in Java, it is not recommended. Static classes are not as flexible as non-static classes, and they can lead to difficulties in code maintenance and debugging.
