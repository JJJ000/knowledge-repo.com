tldr: In Java, multiple variables can be initialized to the same value by using the assignment operator (=) followed by the value to assign.

##### Declaration

Multiple variables can be declared with the same type and value in Java using the following syntax: 

`<type> <variable1>, <variable2>, <variable3> = <value>`

##### Example

For example, the following code will declare three integer variables, `x`, `y`, and `z` with the value of `5`:

`int x, y, z = 5;`

##### Note

It is important to note that this syntax only works when the variables are declared at the same time and assigned the same value. If any of the variables are assigned a different value, the syntax will not work.
