# Answer

## What is a Java Lambda Expression
A Java lambda expression is a block of code that can be used to pass functionality as an argument to a method. It is an anonymous function that can be used to provide a concise way to represent a single method interface, such as an event handler or a comparator.

## What Does "Not Supported at this Language Level" Mean
This error message means that the Java compiler does not recognize the lambda expression as valid syntax. It is likely that the version of Java being used is too old to support lambda expressions.

## How to Resolve the Error
To resolve this error, the user should upgrade their version of Java to a version that supports lambda expressions. The current version of Java is version 14, which supports lambda expressions.

## Summary
Java lambda expressions are a powerful tool for passing functionality as an argument to a method. However, if the version of Java being used is too old, the compiler will not recognize the lambda expression as valid syntax and will throw an error. To resolve this error, the user should upgrade their version of Java to a version that supports lambda expressions.
