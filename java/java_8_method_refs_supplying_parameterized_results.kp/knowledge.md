tldr: A Java 8 method reference can be used to provide a Supplier that supplies a parameterized result by referencing a method that takes a parameter and returns a result.

`**` Overview**

Java 8 method references are a convenient way to refer to existing methods without having to explicitly invoke them. They can be used to supply a parameterized result, allowing for more concise code and improved readability.

`**` Syntax**

The syntax for a method reference is `ClassName::methodName`. This can be used to refer to any static or instance method that has a compatible signature.

`**` Example**

For example, let's say we have a class called `MyClass` with a method called `getValue` that takes an `int` parameter and returns a `String` result. We could use a method reference to supply a parameterized result like this:

```java
Supplier<String> supplier = MyClass::getValue;
String result = supplier.get(5);
```

`**` Benefits**

Using method references allows us to avoid explicitly invoking the method, making our code more concise and readable. It also makes it easier to pass the method as an argument to other methods.
