# Overview

Java's `getResourceAsStream` method is used to retrieve a `InputStream` from a specified resource. In certain cases, this method can return `null`, which can be confusing and difficult to debug. This article will discuss why this happens and how to handle it.

# Causes of getResourceAsStream Returning Null

There are several potential causes for `getResourceAsStream` returning `null`. These include:

1. The resource specified does not exist.
2. The resource is not accessible due to insufficient permissions.
3. The resource is in a different class loader than the one used to invoke `getResourceAsStream`.

# Handling getResourceAsStream Returning Null

When `getResourceAsStream` returns `null`, the first step is to ensure that the resource actually exists. If it does, then the permissions of the resource should be checked to make sure it is accessible. Finally, the class loader used to invoke `getResourceAsStream` should be checked to make sure it is the same one that contains the resource.

If all of these checks pass, then it may be necessary to debug the code to determine the exact cause of the issue. This can be done by setting breakpoints and stepping through the code to see where the issue is occurring.
