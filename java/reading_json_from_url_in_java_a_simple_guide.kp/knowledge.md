##### Step 1: Establish a Connection

First, you need to establish a connection to the URL from which you are reading the JSON data. This can be done using the `java.net.URL` class.

##### Step 2: Read the Data

Once the connection is established, you can use the `java.io.InputStreamReader` and `java.io.BufferedReader` classes to read the data from the URL.

##### Step 3: Parse the Data

After the data is read, you can use a JSON parser library such as Jackson or Gson to parse the data into a Java object.

##### Step 4: Use the Data

Once the data is parsed, you can use it in your application as needed.
