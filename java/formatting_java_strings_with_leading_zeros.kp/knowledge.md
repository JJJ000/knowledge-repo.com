[TOC]

**Section 1: Understanding the Problem**

The problem is to format a Java string with a leading zero. This means that the string should start with a zero, followed by any other characters.

**Section 2: Choosing the Right Method**

The best way to format a Java string with a leading zero is to use the `String.format()` method. This method allows you to specify the format of the string and can be used to add a leading zero.

**Section 3: Formatting the String**

To format a Java string with a leading zero, you can use the following code:

```java
String myString = String.format("%02d", myNumber);
```

This code will add a leading zero to the string, if necessary. The `%02d` specifies that the string should be two digits long, with a leading zero if needed.

**Section 4: Example**

For example, the following code will format the number `5` as `05`:

```java
int myNumber = 5;
String myString = String.format("%02d", myNumber);
System.out.println(myString); // prints "05"
```
