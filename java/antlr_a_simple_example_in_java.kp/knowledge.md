tldr: Yes, a simple example in Java would be to print `Hello World` to the console.

#### Overview
Java is a popular programming language and can be used to create a variety of applications. ANTLR is a parser generator for reading, processing, executing, or translating structured text or binary files. ANTLR can be used to create parsers in Java that can be used to process text or binary files.

#### Example
The following is an example of a simple Java application that uses ANTLR to parse a text file. This example assumes that the text file contains a list of numbers, one per line.

```
// Create an ANTLR input stream from the text file
ANTLRInputStream input = new ANTLRInputStream(new FileInputStream("numbers.txt"));

// Create a lexer that feeds off of input CharStream
MyLexer lexer = new MyLexer(input);

// Create a buffer of tokens pulled from the lexer
CommonTokenStream tokens = new CommonTokenStream(lexer);

// Create a parser that feeds off the tokens buffer
MyParser parser = new MyParser(tokens);

// Begin parsing at rule 'r'
ParseTree tree = parser.r();

// Create a generic parse tree walker
ParseTreeWalker walker = new ParseTreeWalker();

// Walk the tree created during the parse, trigger callbacks
walker.walk(new MyListener(), tree);
```

#### Explanation
In the example, an ANTLR input stream is created from the text file. The input stream is then used to create a lexer which is used to create a buffer of tokens. The tokens are then used to create a parser. The parser is then used to create a parse tree which is then used to create a generic parse tree walker. Finally, the parse tree walker is used to walk the tree and trigger callbacks.

#### Conclusion
This example demonstrates how ANTLR can be used in Java to parse a text file. By using ANTLR, developers can create parsers that can be used to process text or binary files.
