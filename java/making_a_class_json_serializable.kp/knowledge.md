### Implementing the Serializable Interface

The most straightforward way to make a class JSON serializable is to implement the `Serializable` interface. The `Serializable` interface is a marker interface that tells the JVM that the class is capable of being serialized. This will allow the object to be represented as a JSON string.

### Overriding the `toJSONString()` Method

The `Serializable` interface does not provide any methods for serializing an object to JSON. To do this, you will need to override the `toJSONString()` method. This method should return a JSON string representation of the object.

### Adding Getters and Setters

In order to serialize an object to JSON, you will need to add getter and setter methods for each of the object's properties. This will allow the `toJSONString()` method to access the object's properties and serialize them to JSON.

### Writing a Custom Serializer

If you need to serialize an object to JSON in a custom way, you can write a custom serializer. This is a class that implements the `JsonSerializer` interface and provides a `serialize()` method that takes an object and returns a JSON string representation of it. This allows you to customize the JSON output for your object.
