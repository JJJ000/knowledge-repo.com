tldr: It is recommended to initialize class fields in the constructor, although they can also be initialized at declaration.

1. Initializing Fields in Constructor 

When a new object is created, the constructor is called to initialize the fields of the object. The constructor can be used to set the initial values of the class fields. This ensures that all fields are initialized with the same values when the object is created. 

2. Initializing Fields at Declaration 

Fields can also be initialized at the time of declaration. This is done by assigning a value to the field when it is declared. This is useful if the value of the field will not change. The field can be declared and initialized in one line of code. 

3. Advantages of Initializing Fields in Constructor 

Initializing fields in the constructor allows for more flexibility. The values of the fields can be set based on parameters passed to the constructor. This allows the same class to be used to create multiple objects with different values. 

4. Advantages of Initializing Fields at Declaration 

Initializing fields at declaration is simpler and more concise. This can make the code easier to read and understand. It also ensures that the fields are always initialized to the same value.
