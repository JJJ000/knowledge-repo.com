### IntelliJ

IntelliJ does not include support for Maven plugins out of the box. To use Maven plugins in IntelliJ, users must install a plugin such as the Maven Helper Plugin.

### Maven Helper Plugin

The Maven Helper Plugin is a plugin for IntelliJ that provides support for Maven plugins. It allows users to search and install Maven plugins, view their documentation, and manage their dependencies.

### Installation

To install the Maven Helper Plugin, users can open the IntelliJ settings, select Plugins, search for “Maven Helper”, and then click Install.

### Usage

Once the Maven Helper Plugin is installed, users can access the Maven plugins by clicking the Maven icon in the IntelliJ toolbar. From there, users can search for and install the desired Maven plugins.
