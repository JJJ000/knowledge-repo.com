# Section 1: What is Eclipse?
Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE) for writing, compiling, and debugging software. It is written primarily in Java and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile platforms.

# Section 2: What is Java?
Java is a general-purpose programming language that is class-based, object-oriented, and designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is used to develop applications that can run on any Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

# Section 3: What is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?
A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that can execute Java bytecode. It is a software implementation of a computer that executes code written in the Java programming language.

# Section 4: Does Eclipse Require a JRE/JDK?
No, Eclipse does not require a JRE/JDK to be installed. However, it is necessary for developers to install a JRE/JDK in order to compile and run Java programs.
