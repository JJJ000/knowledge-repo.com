### Gathering the Necessary Information 
Before you can start uploading files to a server using JSP/Servlet in Java, you will need to gather the necessary information. This includes the file path of the file you want to upload, the URL of the server you want to upload to, and the type of file you are uploading.

### Establishing an HTTP Connection
Once you have the necessary information, you can start establishing an HTTP connection to the server. This can be done using the HttpURLConnection class in Java. This class allows you to set the request method, headers, and other parameters for the connection.

### Sending the File
Once the connection is established, you can start sending the file. This can be done using the OutputStream class in Java. This class allows you to write the file to the server using a stream.

### Processing the Response
Once the file is sent, you can start processing the response. This can be done using the InputStream class in Java. This class allows you to read the response from the server and process it accordingly.
