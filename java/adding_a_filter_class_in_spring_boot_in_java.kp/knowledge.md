[TOC]

1. Create the Filter Class

Create a class that implements the `javax.servlet.Filter` interface. This class will contain the code to perform your desired filtering.

2. Register the Filter

Create a `@Configuration` class and add a `@Bean` method that returns an instance of your filter.

3. Add the Filter to the Filter Chain

Create a `@Configuration` class and add a `@Bean` method that returns an instance of `FilterRegistrationBean` and use the `addUrlPatterns()` method to add the URL patterns that should be filtered.

4. Configure the Filter

In the `@Bean` method, use the `setInitParameters()` method to set the configuration parameters for the filter.
