tldr: JUnit @Rule allows for the definition of methods that can be used to modify the behavior of tests, such as setting up and tearing down test fixtures.

## Overview
JUnit @Rule is an annotation that allows developers to define custom rules for their unit tests. These rules are applied before and after each test method, and can be used to modify the environment in which the test is run. This allows developers to create more comprehensive tests that are more resilient to changes in the environment.

## Usage
To use JUnit @Rule, developers must first define a class that implements the TestRule interface. This class should contain the logic for the rule, including any setup or teardown operations that need to be performed. The developer then annotates the test method with the @Rule annotation, passing in an instance of the TestRule class.

## Benefits
Using JUnit @Rule allows developers to easily define custom rules for their tests. This can help to ensure that the tests are more resilient to changes in the environment, and can also help to reduce code duplication. Additionally, the rules can be reused across different tests, which can help to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written.

## Limitations
The main limitation of JUnit @Rule is that it can only be used in JUnit 4 and above. Additionally, the rules cannot be used to modify the behavior of the tests themselves, as they are only applied before and after the test. Finally, the rules cannot be used to modify the behavior of other tests, as they are only applied to the test method they are annotated with.
