### Definition

An uber jar is a self-contained executable Java archive that includes all of its dependencies. This means that the jar can be executed without needing to install any additional libraries or frameworks.

### Benefits

An uber jar offers several benefits for developers. It simplifies the deployment process, as all necessary dependencies are included. It also reduces the size of the jar, as all of the dependencies are packaged together. Finally, it makes it easier to debug applications, as all of the dependencies are in one place.

### Usage

Uber jars are typically used in applications that need to be deployed across multiple environments. This could include web applications, mobile applications, or desktop applications. The uber jar provides a single, self-contained package that can be deployed without having to worry about installing additional libraries or frameworks.

### Drawbacks

One potential drawback of using an uber jar is that it can become difficult to maintain and update the dependencies. If a dependency is updated, the entire jar needs to be rebuilt to include the updated version. This can be time-consuming and can lead to compatibility issues. Additionally, the size of the jar can become quite large if there are many dependencies included.
