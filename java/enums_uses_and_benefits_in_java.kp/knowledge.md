### What are enums?
Enums are a special type of data type in Java that allow a programmer to define a set of constants. An enum is a keyword that is used to declare an enumerated type, which consists of a set of named constants.

### Why are enums useful in Java?
Enums are useful in Java because they provide a convenient way to define a set of related constants that can be used throughout a program. Enums can also be used to define a set of related methods and variables that can be used in a program. Additionally, enums are more type-safe than using constants, as they are strongly typed and can be used in switch statements. Finally, enums can be used to define a type-safe enumeration of values, which can be used to validate user input.
