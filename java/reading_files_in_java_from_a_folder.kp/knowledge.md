### Getting the File Path

To read all files in a folder, the first step is to obtain the path of the folder. This can be done in multiple ways, depending on the type of application you are writing and the operating system you are running on.

For example, if you are writing a desktop application for Windows, you can use the `java.io.File` class to get the path of a folder. The `getPath()` method of this class can be used to get the path of a folder, given its name.

### Listing the Files

Once you have the path of the folder, you can use the `listFiles()` method of the `java.io.File` class to get a list of all the files in the folder. This method returns an array of `java.io.File` objects, each representing a file in the folder.

### Processing the Files

Now that you have a list of all the files in the folder, you can iterate through the list and process each file. You can use the `File` class to read the contents of the file, or you can use the `java.nio.file` package to read the contents of the file.

### Closing the Streams

Once you have finished processing the files, it is important to close any streams that were opened while reading the files. This can be done using the `close()` method of the `java.io.InputStream` or `java.io.OutputStream` classes.
