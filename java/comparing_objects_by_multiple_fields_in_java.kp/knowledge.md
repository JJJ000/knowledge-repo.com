**1. Using Comparator Interface**

The Comparator interface in Java provides multiple ways to compare objects. It allows us to define a custom comparison logic for a specific class. To compare objects by multiple fields, we can create a Comparator class that implements the compare() method. The compare() method takes two objects as arguments and compares them based on the values of the specified fields.

**2. Using Comparable Interface**

The Comparable interface in Java also provides multiple ways to compare objects. It allows us to define a natural ordering for a specific class. To compare objects by multiple fields, we can create a Comparable class that implements the compareTo() method. The compareTo() method takes two objects as arguments and compares them based on the values of the specified fields.

**3. Using Lambda Expressions**

Lambda expressions in Java provide a concise way to compare objects by multiple fields. To compare objects by multiple fields, we can use a lambda expression to define a comparison logic that takes two objects as arguments and compares them based on the values of the specified fields.

**4. Using Java Streams**

Java Streams provide a powerful way to compare objects by multiple fields. To compare objects by multiple fields, we can use a stream to define a comparison logic that takes two objects as arguments and compares them based on the values of the specified fields.
