### What is the @Transient Annotation?
The @Transient annotation is an annotation used in JPA to indicate that a field or property should not be persisted in the database. This annotation can be used on fields or properties of an entity class, or on getter methods of the entity class.

### When to Use the @Transient Annotation
The @Transient annotation is typically used when a field or property does not need to be persisted in the database. This may be because the field or property is derived from other fields or properties, or because it is not relevant to the application. For example, a field or property that is used to store the current date and time may not need to be persisted in the database.

### Benefits of the @Transient Annotation
Using the @Transient annotation can help to improve the performance of an application. By not persisting fields or properties that are not relevant to the application, the database can be kept smaller and the queries used to access the data can be more efficient. Additionally, using the @Transient annotation can help to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written to access the data, as the fields or properties that are not relevant to the application can be ignored.

### Conclusion
The @Transient annotation is an annotation used in JPA to indicate that a field or property should not be persisted in the database. This annotation can be used to improve the performance of the application by not persisting fields or properties that are not relevant to the application.
