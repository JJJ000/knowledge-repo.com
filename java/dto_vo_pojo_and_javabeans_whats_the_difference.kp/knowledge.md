tldr: DTO (Data Transfer Object) is used to transfer data between processes, VO (Value Object) is a simple Java object containing getter/setter methods for each field, POJO (Plain Old Java Object) is a Java object without any special methods or fields, and JavaBeans are Java objects that adhere to certain conventions.

[TOC]

### DTO
Data Transfer Object (DTO) is an object that carries data between processes. It is used to transfer data between layers of an application, such as the presentation layer and the business layer.

### VO
Value Object (VO) is an object that contains data and is used to transfer data between layers of an application, such as the presentation layer and the business layer. It is usually used to represent a subset of data from a database table.

### POJO
Plain Old Java Object (POJO) is a Java object that does not follow any special conventions or frameworks. It is a regular Java class with instance variables and getter/setter methods.

### JavaBeans
JavaBeans are reusable software components that can be manipulated visually in a builder tool. They are Java classes that follow certain conventions, such as having public getter and setter methods, and implementing the Serializable interface.
