### What is the maven-shade-plugin used for?
The maven-shade-plugin is used to create executable JAR files. It takes a set of input JAR files and combines them into a single, executable JAR file. The plugin also provides the ability to relocate Java packages, which can be used to ensure that the generated JAR file does not conflict with other JAR files in the classpath.

### Why would you want to relocate Java packages?
Relocating Java packages can be used to ensure that the generated JAR file does not conflict with other JAR files in the classpath. This can be useful when deploying applications that use multiple libraries, as it ensures that any classes in the generated JAR file will not conflict with classes from other JAR files. Additionally, it can be used to avoid naming conflicts between packages in different libraries.
