tldr: Normalization in DOM parsing with Java involves the process of restructuring a document`s elements and attributes to ensure that all nodes are in the proper place and that no data is lost.

### Definition
Normalization is the process of transforming a DOM tree into a standard form to enable easier comparison and manipulation of the tree. It involves the rearrangement of nodes and attributes, and the removal of redundant attributes, to produce a tree that is easier to work with.

### Java Implementation
In Java, normalization of a DOM tree is implemented through the normalize() method of the org.w3c.dom.Node interface. This method takes the DOM tree and rearranges the nodes in a standard form. It also removes redundant attributes, such as empty attributes, and attributes with default values.

### Benefits
Normalization of a DOM tree in Java provides several benefits. It makes the tree easier to manipulate and compare, as the nodes and attributes are rearranged into a standard form. It also reduces the size of the tree, as redundant attributes are removed. Finally, it makes the tree more efficient to work with, as the tree is easier to traverse and manipulate.

### Example
The following example shows a DOM tree before and after normalization.

Before Normalization:
```
<node1 attribute1="" attribute2="value2">
    <node2 attribute3="value3">
        <node3 />
    </node2>
</node1>
```

After Normalization:
```
<node1 attribute2="value2">
    <node2 attribute3="value3">
        <node3 />
    </node2>
</node1>
```
