tldr: You can combine two HashMap objects by using the putAll() method.

**Section 1: Iterate Through the Maps**

The first step to combining two HashMap objects is to iterate through each map. This can be done using a for loop. The for loop should start by looping through the first map. For each element in the first map, the loop should check if the same element exists in the second map. If it does, then the values from the two elements should be combined.

**Section 2: Combine Values**

Once the two elements have been identified, the values from each element can be combined. This can be done in a variety of ways, depending on the type of the values. If the values are primitive types (e.g. int, double, etc.), then the values can be added together. If the values are objects, then the values can be merged together.

**Section 3: Add to Combined Map**

Once the values have been combined, the combined element should be added to a new HashMap. This new map will contain all the elements from both of the original maps.

**Section 4: Return Combined Map**

Finally, the combined map should be returned. This will allow the user to access all the elements from both maps in a single object.
