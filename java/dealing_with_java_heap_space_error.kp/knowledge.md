### Increase Heap Size

One way to address this error is to increase the heap size allocated by the JVM by using command line options `-Xms` and `-Xmx`. `-Xms` sets the initial size of the heap while `-Xmx` sets the maximum size of the heap.

### Reduce Memory Footprint

Another approach to resolving this error is to reduce the memory footprint of the application. This could be done by optimizing the code to reduce the number of objects created, use data structures more efficiently, and/or use caching techniques to reduce the number of objects that need to be stored in memory.

### Monitor Memory Usage

It is also important to monitor the memory usage of the application to identify any memory leaks that may be causing the error. This can be done by using a tool such as the Java VisualVM or a profiler.

### Use a 64-bit JVM

Finally, it may be beneficial to switch to a 64-bit JVM as it can address more memory than a 32-bit JVM.
