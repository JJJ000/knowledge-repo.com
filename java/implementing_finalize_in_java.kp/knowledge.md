[TOC]

### Benefits

Finalize() is a method in the Object class that is called by the garbage collector when an object is no longer referenced. It can be used to perform any necessary cleanup operations such as closing open files or releasing resources before the object is completely destroyed.

### Limitations

The main limitation of finalize() is that it is not guaranteed to be called. The garbage collector may decide to skip the finalize() method if it does not have enough time or resources. This means that any resources or operations that are supposed to be performed by finalize() may never be executed.

### Alternatives

An alternative to finalize() is to use the try-with-resources statement which ensures that resources are closed even if an exception is thrown. This is a much more reliable way of ensuring that resources are released and is the recommended approach.

### Conclusion

Finalize() can be used in certain situations to perform necessary cleanup operations, but it is not guaranteed to be called and should not be relied upon. The try-with-resources statement is a much more reliable way of ensuring that resources are released and should be used instead.
