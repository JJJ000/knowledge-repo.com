### Overview
URL encoding is the process of converting characters in a URL string into a format that is readable and accepted by web browsers. It is a way of ensuring that all characters in a URL are correctly represented in the address bar.

### Java Implementation
In Java, URL encoding is done using the java.net.URLEncoder class. This class provides two static methods for encoding and decoding URLs:

•	encode(String s): This method takes a string as an argument and returns the encoded version of the string.
•	decode(String s): This method takes an encoded string as an argument and returns the decoded version of the string.

### Example
Let’s take an example of a URL string:

https://www.example.com/search?q=java+programming

To encode this URL string, we can use the encode() method of the URLEncoder class as follows:

String encodedUrl = URLEncoder.encode("https://www.example.com/search?q=java+programming");

The encoded version of the URL string will be:

https%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Djava%2Bprogramming

### Conclusion
URL encoding is an important process for ensuring that URLs are correctly represented in web browsers. In Java, this process is done using the java.net.URLEncoder class, which provides two methods for encoding and decoding URLs.
