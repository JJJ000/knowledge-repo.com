1. What are Maven Modules? 
Maven modules are individual projects that are part of a larger project. They are organized into a logical tree structure and can be built, tested, and packaged independently. Each module has its own pom.xml file which contains information about the project, such as its dependencies, plugins, and other configuration details.

2. How to Build a Single Module in Java?
Building a single Maven module in Java requires the following steps:

a. Set up the project structure in an IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ.

b. Add a pom.xml file to the project root with the projectâ€™s information.

c. Add the dependencies needed for the project in the pom.xml file.

d. Write the Java code for the module.

e. Compile the code and run any tests that are needed.

f. Package the module into a jar file.

g. Deploy the jar file to a repository.

3. Benefits of Using Maven Modules
Using Maven modules can help to keep projects organized and maintainable. It also allows developers to work on individual modules independently, without having to worry about the entire project. Additionally, Maven modules can be easily shared and reused across different projects.

4. Drawbacks of Using Maven Modules
The main drawback of using Maven modules is that they can be difficult to set up and maintain. Additionally, if there are multiple developers working on the same project, it can be difficult to keep track of who is working on which module. Finally, Maven modules can be difficult to debug since they are all part of a larger project.
