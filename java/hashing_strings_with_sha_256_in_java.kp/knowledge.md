tldr: To hash a String with SHA-256 in Java, use the MessageDigest class and specify `SHA-256` as the algorithm.

1. **Gather Necessary Libraries**

In order to hash a string with SHA-256 in Java, the necessary libraries must be imported. The following libraries should be imported:

```java
import java.security.MessageDigest;
import java.security.NoSuchAlgorithmException;
```

2. **Create SHA-256 Hash Object**

Once the necessary libraries have been imported, an SHA-256 hash object needs to be created. This can be done by using the following code:

```java
MessageDigest sha256 = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
```

3. **Update SHA-256 Hash Object**

Once the SHA-256 hash object has been created, it needs to be updated with the string that needs to be hashed. This can be done by using the following code:

```java
sha256.update(stringToBeHashed.getBytes());
```

4. **Generate SHA-256 Hash**

Finally, the SHA-256 hash can be generated by using the following code:

```java
byte[] hash = sha256.digest();
```
