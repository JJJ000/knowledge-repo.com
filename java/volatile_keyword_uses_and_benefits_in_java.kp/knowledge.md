### What is the Volatile Keyword?
The volatile keyword is a keyword in the Java programming language that indicates that a variable's value will be modified by different threads.

### What Does the Volatile Keyword Do?
The volatile keyword ensures that any thread that reads a field will see the most recently written value. This is useful in situations where different threads are accessing the same variable, as it ensures that all threads are accessing the same value.

### When Should the Volatile Keyword Be Used?
The volatile keyword should be used when a variable needs to be accessed by multiple threads. It should also be used when the variable is being updated by one thread and read by another. 

### Benefits of Using the Volatile Keyword
Using the volatile keyword can help to prevent thread interference and memory consistency errors, as it ensures that all threads are accessing the same value. Additionally, using the volatile keyword can help to improve the performance of a program, as it eliminates the need for synchronization.
