[TOC]

1. # Format 
The convention for word separator in Java package names is to use lowercase letters and to separate words with a period (.).

2. # Capitalization 
The convention is to use all lowercase letters when naming packages, classes, and interfaces.

3. # Naming 
Package names should be all lowercase and use a hierarchical naming structure. The package name should be descriptive and should be related to the project or application.

4. # Abbreviations 
Abbreviations should be avoided as they can be confusing and difficult to remember. If an abbreviation is used, it should be kept consistent throughout the project.
