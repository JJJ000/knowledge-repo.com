### FileInputStream and FileOutputStream

To copy a file in Java, the most concise way is to use the `FileInputStream` and `FileOutputStream` classes. This involves the following steps:

1. Create a `FileInputStream` object for the source file.
2. Create a `FileOutputStream` object for the destination file.
3. Read data from the source file using the `read()` method of the `FileInputStream` class.
4. Write the read data into the destination file using the `write()` method of the `FileOutputStream` class.
5. Close both the streams using the `close()` method.
