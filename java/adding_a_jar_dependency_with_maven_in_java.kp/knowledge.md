### Adding a Dependency in Maven

Maven is a popular build automation tool used for Java projects. It allows developers to easily manage project dependencies and build Java applications.

### Adding a Dependency by Relative Path

To add a dependency to a jar by relative path in Java using Maven, you first need to add the jar to your projectâ€™s lib directory. Then, you need to add the following code to your pom.xml file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>example-jar</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <scope>system</scope>
    <systemPath>${project.basedir}/lib/example-jar.jar</systemPath>
</dependency>
```

Replace `example-jar` with the name of your jar file and `1.0.0` with the version of your jar file.

### Verifying the Dependency

Once you have added the dependency to your project, you can verify that it is working correctly by running the following command:

```
mvn dependency:tree
```

This command will list all of the dependencies in your project, including the one you just added. If the jar file is listed, then the dependency has been successfully added.
