### Meaning

A "Cannot find symbol" or "Cannot resolve symbol" error in Java is an error that is thrown when the compiler cannot find a symbol, such as a variable or a method, that is referenced in the code. This can happen for a variety of reasons, such as when a symbol is misspelled or when a symbol is not imported properly.

### Examples

For example, if a variable is declared but not initialized, the compiler will throw a "Cannot find symbol" error. Similarly, if a class is not imported properly, the compiler will throw a "Cannot resolve symbol" error.

### Resolution

To resolve these errors, the code must be checked for any typos or incorrect imports. Once the errors have been fixed, the code can be recompiled and the errors should be resolved.
