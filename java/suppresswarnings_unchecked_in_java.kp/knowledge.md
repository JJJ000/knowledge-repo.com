### Definition
SuppressWarnings("unchecked") is an annotation in Java that tells the compiler to suppress specific warnings that are generated by the Java program due to unchecked operations.

### Usage
This annotation can be used to suppress warnings that are generated due to unsafe type casts, raw types, unchecked conversions, and unchecked generic array creations.

### Benefits
Using this annotation can help to reduce the number of warnings that are generated by the compiler and make the code more readable. Additionally, it can help to improve the performance of the program by avoiding unnecessary checks.

### Drawbacks
The use of this annotation can lead to potential runtime errors if the unchecked operations are not handled properly. Therefore, it is important to understand the potential risks of using this annotation before using it in a program.
