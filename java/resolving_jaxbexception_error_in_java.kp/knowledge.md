### Solution 1: 

### Add Dependency 

The root cause of this error is that the JAXB API classes are not available in the classpath. To resolve this issue, add the JAXB API dependency to the project. 

### Solution 2: 

### Check for Compatible Version 

Make sure to check the version of the JAXB API you are using is compatible with the version of the Java compiler. If the version of the JAXB API is not compatible with the version of the Java compiler, it can cause this error. 

### Solution 3: 

### Check for Missing Dependencies 

If the JAXB API is present in the classpath, then check for any missing dependencies. This error can also occur if some of the dependent classes of the JAXB API are missing in the classpath. 

### Solution 4: 

### Check for Duplicate Dependencies 

If the JAXB API is present in the classpath, then check for any duplicate dependencies. This error can also occur if multiple versions of the same dependency are present in the classpath.
