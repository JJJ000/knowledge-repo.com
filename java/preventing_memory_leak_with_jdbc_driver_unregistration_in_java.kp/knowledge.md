### What is a Memory Leak?
A memory leak is a type of software bug where a program or process fails to release memory after it has been used. This can lead to a gradual decrease in system performance as more and more resources are consumed by the program or process.

### How Does a Memory Leak Occur?
A memory leak occurs when a program or process does not release memory that it has allocated for use. This can happen when the program or process fails to properly manage the memory that it has allocated, or when it fails to release the memory when it is no longer needed.

### How Does the JDBC Driver Help Prevent Memory Leaks?
The JDBC Driver helps prevent memory leaks by providing an API that allows applications to register and unregister JDBC Drivers. This allows applications to control how much memory is allocated for each JDBC Driver, and to release the memory when it is no longer needed.

### What Happens if a Memory Leak Occurs?
If a memory leak occurs, the JDBC Driver can be forcibly unregistered in Java. This will release the memory that was allocated for the JDBC Driver, and the system will no longer be affected by the memory leak.
