### Definition
A Data Access Object (DAO) is an object that provides an abstract interface to some type of database or other persistence mechanism. By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, DAOs provide some specific data operations without exposing details of the database.

### Purpose
The purpose of a DAO is to provide an abstraction layer between the application and the persistence layer of the software. This allows for decoupling of the application from the data source and makes it easier to switch data sources without having to change the application code.

### Benefits
1. Improved Maintainability: By separating the data access code from the business logic, the code is easier to maintain.
2. Improved Testability: By separating the data access code from the business logic, it is easier to test the application.
3. Improved Performance: By using DAOs, you can optimize the data access code and improve the performance of the application.
4. Improved Security: By using DAOs, you can improve the security of the application by restricting access to the data layer.
