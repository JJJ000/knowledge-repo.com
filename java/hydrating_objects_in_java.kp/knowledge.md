### Definition
Hydrating an object in Java is the process of taking a set of data and reconstructing an object from it. This is typically done when an object is being read from a database or other form of persistent storage. 

### Process
The process of hydration involves the following steps:
1. Retrieve the data from the persistent storage.
2. Create a new instance of the object.
3. Set the object's properties using the data retrieved.
4. Return the object.

### Benefits
Hydrating an object in Java is beneficial because it allows for the object to be reconstructed quickly and easily. This can be especially helpful when dealing with large datasets that need to be retrieved from a database. Additionally, this process is often used to reduce the amount of code needed to construct an object from a set of data.
