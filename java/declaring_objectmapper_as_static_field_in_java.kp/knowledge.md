### Advantages

Declaring ObjectMapper as a static field can have some advantages. Firstly, it can help to reduce the amount of memory used by the application, since the same instance of the ObjectMapper can be reused for multiple requests. Secondly, it can help to reduce the amount of time spent creating and destroying instances of the ObjectMapper, which can improve the overall performance of the application.

### Disadvantages

Declaring ObjectMapper as a static field can also have some disadvantages. Firstly, it can lead to thread safety issues, since multiple threads may be accessing the same instance of the ObjectMapper. Secondly, it can lead to memory leaks, since the ObjectMapper instance may not be properly garbage collected when it is no longer needed.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, declaring ObjectMapper as a static field can have both advantages and disadvantages. It is important to consider the specific needs of the application before deciding whether or not to use this approach. In some cases, it may be beneficial to declare ObjectMapper as a static field, while in other cases it may not be necessary or even desirable.
