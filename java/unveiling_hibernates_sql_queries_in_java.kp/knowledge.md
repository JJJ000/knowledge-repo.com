[TOC]

### Configuration

To enable Hibernate to show real SQL in Java, you will need to make a few configuration changes.

First, you will need to set the `hibernate.show_sql` property to `true` in the `hibernate.cfg.xml` file. This will enable Hibernate to show the SQL statements that are being executed.

Second, you will need to set the `hibernate.format_sql` property to `true` in the `hibernate.cfg.xml` file. This will enable Hibernate to format the SQL statements for readability.

### Logging

In addition to the configuration changes, you will also need to configure logging to see the real SQL statements.

In the `log4j.properties` file, you will need to set the log level for the `org.hibernate.SQL` logger to `DEBUG`. This will enable Hibernate to log the real SQL statements.

### Code

Once the configuration and logging are set up, you can use the `Session.createSQLQuery()` method to execute SQL statements and view the real SQL in the logs.

### Example

For example, the following code will execute a SQL query and display the real SQL in the logs:

```java
Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
String sql = "SELECT * FROM users";
Query query = session.createSQLQuery(sql);
List<Object[]> results = query.list();
```

The real SQL statement that is generated will be displayed in the logs.
