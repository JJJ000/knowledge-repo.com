### What is serialVersionUID?
serialVersionUID is a unique identifier for a Serializable class. It is used during the deserialization process to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization.

### Why IntelliJ IDEA Generates serialVersionUID?
IntelliJ IDEA generates a serialVersionUID for a class when it is marked as Serializable. This is done to ensure that the class can be serialized and deserialized properly.

### How to Generate serialVersionUID?
In IntelliJ IDEA, you can generate a serialVersionUID by right-clicking on the class and selecting the Generate option. Then, select the Serial Version UID option. This will generate a unique serialVersionUID for the class.

### Benefits of Generating serialVersionUID
Generating a serialVersionUID ensures that the class can be serialized and deserialized properly. This helps to ensure that objects can be sent and received properly between different applications.
