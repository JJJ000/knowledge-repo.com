tldr: Polymorphism is the ability for objects of different types to respond to the same method call, Overriding is the ability for a subclass to redefine the implementation of a method of its superclass, and Overloading is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism is a concept in object-oriented programming in which an object can take on many different forms. It allows objects to be treated differently based on their data type or class. A polymorphic object can be used in place of any of its parent or child classes. 

### Overriding
Overriding is a concept in object-oriented programming in which a subclass or child class redefines a method inherited from its parent or superclass. The overriding method has the same name, parameters, and return type as the method it is overriding. 

### Overloading
Overloading is a concept in object-oriented programming in which multiple methods of the same name are defined with different parameters. This allows the same method name to be used to perform different tasks based on the parameters passed to it.
