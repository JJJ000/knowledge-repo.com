[TOC]

1. ## Using Comparator 
   To sort an ArrayList using a Comparator, we need to create a Comparator implementation to define the sorting logic. Then, we use the Collections.sort() method and pass the Comparator implementation to it.

2. ## Using Comparable 
   To sort an ArrayList using Comparable, we need to implement the Comparable interface in the class whose objects are stored in the ArrayList. Then, we can use the Collections.sort() method to sort the ArrayList.

3. ## Using Lambda Expressions 
   To sort an ArrayList using Lambda expressions, we can use the Collections.sort() method and pass a lambda expression as the Comparator. The lambda expression should contain the sorting logic.

4. ## Using Java 8 Stream API 
   To sort an ArrayList using Java 8 Stream API, we can use the Stream.sorted() method and pass a Comparator to it. The Comparator should contain the sorting logic.
