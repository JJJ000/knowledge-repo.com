tldr: Object serialization in Java is the process of converting an object`s state to a sequence of bytes, which can be stored in a file or transmitted over a network.

### Definition
Object serialization is the process of converting an object's state to a byte stream, which can then be persisted, sent over the network, or used to recreate the object in memory.

### Benefits
Object serialization is beneficial because it allows developers to easily save and restore objects by converting them into a stream of bytes. This stream can then be stored on disk or sent over the network. The bytes can then be used to reconstruct the object in memory. This can be used to persist data, or to send objects over a network.

### Limitations
Object serialization can be slow and can be vulnerable to security issues. It also requires the object to be serializable, meaning that all of its fields must be serializable as well. Additionally, if the object's structure changes, the serialized version may become outdated and no longer be usable.

### Alternatives
An alternative to object serialization is to use a database to persist objects. This allows for more flexibility and scalability, as the data can be queried and updated. Additionally, it is more secure and efficient than object serialization.
