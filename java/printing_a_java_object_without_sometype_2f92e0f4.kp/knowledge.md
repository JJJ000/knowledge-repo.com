### Using toString()

The toString() method is a method defined in the Object class, which is the parent class of all Java classes. This method is used to return a string representation of an object. By overriding this method in your class, you can provide your own implementation of how an object should be represented as a string.

### Using a Custom Formatter

If you want to have more control over the string representation of your object, you can create a custom formatter. A custom formatter is a class that implements the Formatter interface and provides a custom implementation of the format() method. This method takes in an object and returns a string representation of it.

### Using a StringBuilder

You can also use a StringBuilder to create a string representation of your object. A StringBuilder is a mutable sequence of characters that allows you to easily build up a string representation of your object. You can use the append() method to add different parts of your object to the StringBuilder, and then use the toString() method to get the final string representation.

### Using a JSON Library

Finally, you can use a JSON library to create a string representation of your object. A JSON library is a library that allows you to convert an object into a JSON string. This is a great way to get a string representation of your object that is easy to read and parse.
