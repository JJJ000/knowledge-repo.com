1. **Set the Menu Text** 

To change the menu item text dynamically in Android, you need to use the `setTitle()` method. This method takes a `CharSequence` as a parameter, which is the text you want to set as the menu item's title.

2. **Retrieve the Menu Item** 

To set the menu item text, you must first retrieve the menu item you want to change. This can be done by using the `findItem()` method of the `Menu` class. This method takes the resource ID of the menu item as an argument and returns a `MenuItem` object.

3. **Change the Text** 

Once you have retrieved the menu item, you can use the `setTitle()` method to set the text. This method takes a `CharSequence` as an argument, which should be the text you want to set as the menu item's title.

4. **Update the Menu** 

Finally, you need to update the menu to reflect the changes you have made. This can be done by using the `invalidateOptionsMenu()` method of the `Activity` class. This will cause the menu to be recreated and the changes you have made will be visible.
