[TOC]

### Yes

Java 8 is supported on Android devices running API level 24 or higher (Android 7.0 Nougat and above). This means that developers can use Java 8 language features, such as lambda expressions, method references, and the new Java 8 type interface.

### Advantages

Using Java 8 for Android development has many advantages. It allows developers to use modern language features, such as lambdas, to simplify their code and make it more concise. Additionally, the new type interface allows developers to create more flexible APIs and better abstractions. Finally, Java 8 also includes performance improvements that can help speed up code execution.

### Disadvantages

One potential disadvantage of using Java 8 for Android development is that it requires a device running API level 24 or higher. This means that devices running an older version of Android wonâ€™t be able to use the new features. Additionally, Java 8 is still relatively new, so there may be some bugs or compatibility issues that developers need to work around.

### Conclusion

Overall, it is possible to use Java 8 for Android development. It offers many advantages, such as improved performance and modern language features, but it also requires a device running API level 24 or higher. Developers should be aware of the potential issues that can arise when using Java 8 and should thoroughly test their code before releasing it.
