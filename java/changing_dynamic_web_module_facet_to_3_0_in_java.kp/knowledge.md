### Introduction

The Dynamic Web Module project facet is a feature of the Eclipse Java EE IDE that allows users to create web applications. It is a part of the Java EE platform and provides a framework for developing web applications. The Dynamic Web Module project facet is based on the Java Servlet specification and provides a set of tools for developing web applications.

### Problem

The problem is that the version of the Dynamic Web Module project facet cannot be changed from 2.5 to 3.0 in Java. This is because the version of the Java EE platform that is used in Java is not compatible with the version of the Dynamic Web Module project facet that is available in Java.

### Solution

The solution to this problem is to upgrade the version of the Java EE platform that is used in Java. The latest version of the Java EE platform is Java EE 8, which is compatible with the latest version of the Dynamic Web Module project facet (3.0). By upgrading to Java EE 8, users can use the latest version of the Dynamic Web Module project facet in their Java applications.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the version of the Dynamic Web Module project facet cannot be changed from 2.5 to 3.0 in Java because the version of the Java EE platform that is used in Java is not compatible with the version of the Dynamic Web Module project facet that is available in Java. The solution to this problem is to upgrade the version of the Java EE platform that is used in Java to the latest version (Java EE 8), which is compatible with the latest version of the Dynamic Web Module project facet (3.0).
