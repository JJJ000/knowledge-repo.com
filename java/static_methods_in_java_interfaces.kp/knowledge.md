tldr: Static methods cannot be defined in Java interfaces because they are not inherited by implementing classes.

### Reason

Static methods are associated with a class, not an instance of a class. Interfaces cannot contain any implementation details, only abstract methods and constant declarations.

### Benefits of Interfaces

Interfaces provide a way to achieve abstraction in Java. They are used to define a contract between two unrelated objects so that if one object changes, the other object doesn't need to be changed. Interfaces also allow for loose coupling between objects.

### Alternative

A better alternative to using a static method in an interface is to use a class with a static method. This way, the static method can be used in any class that implements the interface.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, static methods cannot be defined in a Java interface because they are associated with a class, not an instance of a class. Interfaces provide a way to achieve abstraction and loose coupling between objects. A better alternative is to use a class with a static method that can be used in any class that implements the interface.
