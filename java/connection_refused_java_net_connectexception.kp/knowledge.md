# Overview
Java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused is an error thrown when an application tries to connect to a remote address but is denied. This can occur due to a variety of reasons, including a firewall blocking the connection or the remote host not responding.

# Causes
The most common cause of this error is that the remote host is not responding to the connection. This can occur if the remote host is down or if there is a firewall blocking the connection. Additionally, the error can occur if the remote host is not configured to accept incoming connections.

# Troubleshooting
If you are experiencing this error, the first step should be to check the status of the remote host. Ensure that it is up and running and that it is configured to accept incoming connections. If the remote host is running, try disabling any firewalls that may be blocking the connection. Additionally, check that the application is configured correctly and that the correct ports are open.
