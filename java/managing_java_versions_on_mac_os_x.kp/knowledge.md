### Installing Multiple Java Versions

Mac OS X allows users to install multiple versions of Java on their system. To do so, users must first download the desired version of Java from the official Oracle website. Once downloaded, the user should double-click the downloaded file to launch the Java installer. The installer will then guide the user through the installation process.

### Setting Default Java Version

Once multiple versions of Java are installed, the user can set the default version of Java to be used when running Java applications. To do this, the user must open the Java Control Panel and select the “Java” tab. Here, the user can select the desired version of Java from the drop-down menu.

### Verifying Installation

To verify that the desired version of Java is correctly installed, the user can open the Terminal application and type “java -version”. This will print out the version of Java that is currently being used.

### Uninstalling Java Versions

If the user wishes to uninstall any of the installed Java versions, they can do so by opening the Java Control Panel and selecting the “Uninstall” tab. Here, the user can select the version of Java they wish to uninstall and then click “Uninstall”.
