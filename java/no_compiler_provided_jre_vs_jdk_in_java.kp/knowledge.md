#1 What is a Compiler?
A compiler is a program that takes source code written in a programming language and converts it into a form that can be executed by a computer. It is an essential part of the software development process, as it is responsible for turning the code written by a programmer into a form that the computer can understand.

#2 What is a JRE?
A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a set of software tools for developing Java applications. It includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), the Java Class Library, and other components to run applets and applications written in the Java programming language.

#3 What is a JDK?
A Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (Javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.

#4 Why is a Compiler Needed?
A compiler is needed to convert the code written by a programmer into a form that the computer can understand. This is important because the computer cannot understand the code written in a programming language, and therefore needs to be converted into a form that it can understand. By using a compiler, the code written by the programmer can be converted into a form that the computer can understand and execute.
