## Try-Catch Blocks
In Java, when an exception is caught in a try-catch block, it can be caught again in the same block or in a nested try-catch block. This means that if an exception is thrown inside a catch block, it can be caught again in the same catch block or in a nested catch block.

## Exception Handling
In addition, Java has an exception handling mechanism that allows exceptions to be caught again in the same or different catch blocks. This means that if an exception is thrown inside a catch block, it can be caught again in a different catch block.

## Re-throwing Exceptions
Finally, Java also allows exceptions to be re-thrown. This means that if an exception is thrown inside a catch block, it can be re-thrown and caught again in a different catch block.
