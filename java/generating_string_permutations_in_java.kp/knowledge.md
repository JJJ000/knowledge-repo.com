tldr: The easiest way to generate all permutations of a given string in Java is to use the Collections.permutations() method.

### Using Recursion

Recursion is a process of breaking down a problem into smaller sub-problems. It is a powerful tool for solving problems that have multiple solutions. In this case, we can use recursion to generate all permutations of a given string.

The basic idea is to take the first character of the string, and then recursively generate all permutations of the remaining characters. For example, if the string is "ABC", then the first character is "A" and the remaining characters are "BC". We can then generate all permutations of "BC", which would be "BC", "CB", and "B", and then append "A" to each of these permutations to get "ABC", "ACB", and "BAC".

We can then repeat this process for each of the resulting permutations, and so on until all possible permutations have been generated.

### Using Iteration

Iteration is another way to generate all permutations of a given string. The basic idea is to start with an empty list of permutations, and then iteratively add each character of the string to the beginning of the list, and then generate all permutations of the remaining characters.

For example, if the string is "ABC", then we start with an empty list. We then add "A" to the list, and then generate all permutations of the remaining characters "BC", which would be "BC", "CB", and "B". We then add "A" to each of these permutations to get "ABC", "ACB", and "BAC".

We then repeat this process for each of the resulting permutations, and so on until all possible permutations have been generated.

### Using Libraries

In addition to recursion and iteration, there are also libraries available that can be used to generate all permutations of a given string. These libraries typically provide functions or classes that can be used to generate all permutations in a single line of code.

For example, in Java, there is the Apache Commons Lang library which provides a Permutation class that can be used to generate all permutations of a given string.

### Using Bit Manipulation

Bit manipulation is another approach to generating all permutations of a given string. The basic idea is to represent each character of the string as a bit in an integer, and then use bit manipulation operations to generate all possible permutations.

For example, if the string is "ABC", then we can represent each character as a bit in an integer. We then use bit manipulation operations to generate all possible permutations. For example, we can use the bitwise OR operator to generate all possible combinations of the bits, which will then correspond to all possible permutations of the string.
