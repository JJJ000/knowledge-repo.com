### Math.Divide

The Math.Divide method can be used to produce a double in Java. This method takes two parameters, the numerator and denominator, and returns a double value of the two numbers divided together. 

### Casting

Another way to produce a double in Java is by casting. This involves converting a data type to a double by adding the double keyword to the beginning of the data type. For example, if you have an integer, you can cast it to a double by writing double (intValue).

### Double Constructor

The Double Constructor can be used to produce a double in Java. This constructor takes a double value as a parameter and returns a Double object with the same value.

### Double.parseDouble

The Double.parseDouble method can be used to produce a double in Java. This method takes a string representation of a double as a parameter and returns a double value of the same string.
