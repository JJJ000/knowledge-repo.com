# Section 1: Common Causes

The most common cause of a Spring Boot application shutting down immediately after starting is a misconfigured application. This can be caused by a number of things, including:

- Incorrectly configured application properties
- Incompatible versions of dependencies
- Incorrectly configured database connections
- Missing or incorrect configuration files

# Section 2: Troubleshooting

The best way to troubleshoot an issue with a Spring Boot application is to use the Spring Boot Actuator. The Actuator provides detailed information about the application's state and can help identify the cause of the shutdown.

# Section 3: Logging

It is also important to check the application's log files for any errors or warnings that may be related to the shutdown. This can help pinpoint the cause of the issue and provide more information on how to fix it.

# Section 4: Debugging

Finally, if the issue is still not resolved, it may be necessary to debug the application to identify the cause of the shutdown. This can be done using a debugger tool such as JVisualVM or a Java IDE such as Eclipse.
