### Shortcut

The quickest way to organize imports in IntelliJ is to use the shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + O`. This shortcut will automatically organize the imports in the current file.

### Manual Method

Alternatively, you can manually organize imports by navigating to `Code > Optimize Imports` in the menu. This will open up a dialog where you can select which imports to keep and which to remove.

### Settings

You can also configure IntelliJ to automatically organize imports whenever you save a file. To do this, navigate to `Settings > Editor > General > Auto Import` and select the `Optimize Imports on the fly` option.

### External Libraries

Finally, you can also organize imports for external libraries. To do this, navigate to `Settings > Editor > General > Auto Import` and select the `Add unambiguous imports on the fly` option. This will add imports for any classes from external libraries that are used in the current file.
