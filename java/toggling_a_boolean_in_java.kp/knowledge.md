tldr: The cleanest way to toggle a boolean variable in Java is to assign the opposite of its current value to the variable.

**Option 1: Using the Ternary Operator**

The ternary operator is a concise way of toggling a boolean variable. It takes the form of a single line expression with the syntax `variable = condition ? true-value : false-value`.

For example, to toggle the boolean variable `x`:

`x = x ? false : true;`

**Option 2: Using the Logical Not Operator**

The logical not operator, `!`, can also be used to toggle a boolean variable. It takes the form of a single line expression with the syntax `variable = !variable`.

For example, to toggle the boolean variable `x`:

`x = !x;`

**Option 3: Using the Bitwise XOR Operator**

The bitwise XOR operator, `^`, can also be used to toggle a boolean variable. It takes the form of a single line expression with the syntax `variable = variable ^ true`.

For example, to toggle the boolean variable `x`:

`x = x ^ true;`

**Option 4: Using the Conditional Operator**

The conditional operator, `?:`, can also be used to toggle a boolean variable. It takes the form of a single line expression with the syntax `variable = condition ? true : false`.

For example, to toggle the boolean variable `x`:

`x = x ? false : true;`
