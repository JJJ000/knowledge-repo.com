[TOC]

**Section 1: Declaring a Long**

A long variable can be declared in Java by using the keyword “long” followed by a variable name. For example:

```
long myLong;
```

**Section 2: Initializing a Long**

A long variable can be initialized in Java by assigning a value to it. For example:

```
myLong = 123456789L;
```

Note that a “L” should be appended to the end of the value when assigning a long value.

**Section 3: Assigning a Long**

A long variable can also be assigned a value by using the assignment operator (=). For example:

```
long myLong = 123456789L;
```

**Section 4: Using the new Keyword**

A long variable can also be declared and initialized using the new keyword. For example:

```
long myLong = new Long(123456789L);
```
