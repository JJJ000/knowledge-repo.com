# Section 1: Using File Class
The File class in Java can be used to check if a folder exists. This class is present in the java.io package.

# Section 3: Example Code

```
File file = new File("folder");
if(file.isDirectory()) {
   System.out.println("Folder exists!");
} else {
   System.out.println("Folder does not exist!");
}
```

# Section 4: Conclusion
Using the File class and the isDirectory() method, it is possible to check if a folder exists in Java. The example code snippet provided above can be used to check if a folder exists in the current working directory.
