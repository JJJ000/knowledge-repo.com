[TOC]

####Break
- The break statement is used to terminate the loop and transfer the execution control to the statement immediately following the loop.
- When a break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.

####Continue
- The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and move to the next iteration.
- When a continue statement is encountered inside a loop, the program control directly jumps to the beginning of the loop for next iteration, skipping the execution of statements inside the body of loop for the current iteration.
