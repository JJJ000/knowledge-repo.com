### Increased Readability
Synchronized methods are often easier to read and understand than synchronized blocks. By using synchronized methods, the code becomes more organized and easier to follow. Additionally, because the code is more organized, it is also easier to debug.

### Reduced Code Length
Synchronized methods can also reduce the amount of code needed to achieve synchronization. Synchronized blocks require a try/catch block, which can add complexity and length to the code. By using a synchronized method, this try/catch block is not needed, which can reduce the length of the code.

### Reduced Performance Cost
Synchronized methods can also reduce the performance cost of synchronization. Synchronized blocks require the JVM to acquire the lock associated with the object, while synchronized methods only require the JVM to acquire the lock associated with the class. This can result in a slight performance improvement, as the cost of acquiring a class-level lock is often lower than the cost of acquiring an object-level lock.
