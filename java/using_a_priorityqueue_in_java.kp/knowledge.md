### Adding Items

PriorityQueue is a collection that allows us to add items with a priority. Items with a higher priority will be served before items with a lower priority. To add an item to a PriorityQueue, we use the `add()` or `offer()` methods.

### Retrieving Items

The `poll()` method is used to retrieve and remove the head of the queue. This method returns `null` if the queue is empty. The `peek()` method is used to retrieve, but not remove, the head of the queue. This method also returns `null` if the queue is empty.

### Sorting Items

The items in a PriorityQueue are sorted according to their natural ordering or by a Comparator provided at queue construction time. If no Comparator is provided, the natural ordering of the elements will be used.

### Iterating Through Items

The PriorityQueue does not provide a direct way to iterate through its elements. To iterate through the elements, we can use the `iterator()` method to get an Iterator object. We can then use the `hasNext()` and `next()` methods of the Iterator object to iterate through the elements.
