### JVM

Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a virtual machine that enables a computer to run a Java program. It is the component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that is responsible for interpreting and executing Java bytecode.

### JDK

Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (Java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.

### JRE

Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is a software package that contains what is required to run a Java program. It includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java platform core classes, and supporting files.

### OpenJDK

OpenJDK (Open Java Development Kit) is an open-source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) specification. It is the result of an effort Sun Microsystems began in 2006. The implementation is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) with a linking exception. OpenJDK is the official reference implementation of Java SE since version 7.
