### Definition
A daemon thread in Java is a thread that runs in the background and does not prevent the JVM from exiting when all user threads (non-daemon threads) finish their execution.

### Usage
Daemon threads are typically used to perform background tasks such as garbage collection and logging. They are not suitable for tasks that require user interaction or that return a result.

### Examples
Examples of daemon threads include the garbage collection thread in the JVM, the finalizer thread, and the Reference Handler thread.

### Benefits
The benefit of using daemon threads is that they can be used to perform background tasks without blocking the JVM from exiting. This can help improve the overall performance of the application.
