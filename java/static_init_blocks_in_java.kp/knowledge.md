tldr: Static initialization blocks are used to initialize static variables in a Java class before the class is used by any object.

**Contents**

[TOC]

### Definition
Static initialization blocks are used to initialize static variables in a Java class. These blocks are executed when the class is first loaded, before any other code in the class is executed.

### Syntax
Static initialization blocks are written using the static keyword, followed by a pair of curly braces. Within the curly braces, any valid Java code can be written.

```java
static {
    // code here
}
```

### Usage
Static initialization blocks are typically used to initialize static variables to specific values, such as setting the initial values of an array or setting the value of a constant.

### Advantages
The main advantage of using static initialization blocks is that they are executed only once when the class is first loaded. This means that the code written in the block is only executed once, which can improve the performance of the application.
