### What is a serialVersionUID
A serialVersionUID is a unique identifier for a Serializable class. It is a static final field in a Serializable class which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization.

### Why Should I Use it
1. It helps to identify the version of the class.
2. It helps to detect changes made to the class.
3. It helps to prevent compatibility issues between different versions of the same class.
4. It helps to ensure that the same version of the class is used for both serialization and deserialization.
