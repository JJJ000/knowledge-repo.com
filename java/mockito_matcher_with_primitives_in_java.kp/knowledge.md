#### Mockito Matcher
Mockito Matcher is a powerful utility for matching arguments in unit tests. It allows for more flexible testing, as it allows for matching of complex objects, as well as primitive values. It is often used to verify method arguments, as well as to create mock objects.

#### Array of Primitives
An array of primitives is a data structure consisting of an array of primitive data types such as integers, characters, and booleans. This type of data structure is useful when dealing with collections of data that need to be stored and accessed quickly. Arrays of primitives are also used to store data in memory, as they are much more efficient than other data structures such as linked lists.
