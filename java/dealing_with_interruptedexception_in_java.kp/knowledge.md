tldr: InterruptedException should be handled by restoring the interrupted status of the thread and then exiting the code block.

1. ##What is InterruptedException?
InterruptedException is an exception that occurs when a thread is waiting, sleeping, or otherwise occupied, and the thread is interrupted, either before or during the activity.

2. ##Causes of InterruptedException
InterruptedException can occur if a thread is blocked waiting for a monitor lock, and another thread interrupts it using the interrupt() method. It can also occur if a thread is sleeping or waiting for a long time and is interrupted by another thread.

3. ##Handling InterruptedException
InterruptedException can be handled by catching it in a try/catch block and responding appropriately. The thread should be interrupted using the interrupt() method, and the interrupted flag should be set to true. The interrupted flag should be checked periodically, and if it is set to true, the thread should take appropriate action.

4. ##Conclusion
InterruptedException is an exception that occurs when a thread is waiting, sleeping, or otherwise occupied and is interrupted by another thread. It can be handled by catching it in a try/catch block and responding appropriately. The thread should also be interrupted using the interrupt() method, and the interrupted flag should be checked periodically.
