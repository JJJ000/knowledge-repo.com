### Definition
An annotation is a special form of syntactic meta-data that can be added to Java source code. Annotations provide data about a program that is not part of the program itself. They have no direct effect on the operation of the code they annotate.

### Reason
Annotations are immutable, meaning they cannot be changed once they are created. This is because annotations are actually stored as class files in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Since the JVM does not allow for the modification of class files, it is not possible to extend annotations.
