`**` Using Include Files**

Using include files is a great way to make templating easier in Java. This involves breaking up the JSP page into smaller files and including them into the main page. This allows for code reuse and makes it easier to find and modify the code. It also makes it easier to maintain the code since each include file can be modified without having to modify the main page.

`**` Using Tag Libraries**

Using tag libraries is another great way to make templating easier in Java. Tag libraries provide a way to write custom tags that can be used to simplify and reduce the amount of code needed to create a template. This makes it easier to create complex layouts and allows for code reuse.

`**` Using Custom Tags**

Custom tags can be used to create reusable components that can be used in multiple templates. This allows for code reuse and makes it easier to maintain the code since the custom tag can be modified without having to modify the main page.

`**` Using CSS**

Using CSS is a great way to make templating easier in Java. CSS can be used to create a consistent look and feel across the page, allowing for the same code to be used in multiple templates. This makes it easier to maintain the code since the CSS can be modified without having to modify the main page.
