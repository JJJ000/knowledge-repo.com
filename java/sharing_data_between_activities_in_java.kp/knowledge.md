# Using Intents
Intents are a powerful tool that allow activities to communicate with each other. They are used to pass data between activities and can be used to start activities, services, and broadcast receivers. Intents can contain a variety of data, including primitives, bundles, and Parcelable objects.

# Using SharedPreferences
SharedPreferences are used to store data in key-value pairs. They are commonly used to store user preferences and app settings. SharedPreferences can be used to share data between activities. The data is stored in an XML file, which can be accessed from any activity.

# Using Singletons
Singletons are a design pattern which is used to ensure that only one instance of a class is created. They are commonly used to share data between activities. The data is stored in a static variable and can be accessed from any activity.

# Using SQLite
SQLite is a lightweight database which can be used to store data. It is commonly used to store user data such as preferences and settings. SQLite can be used to share data between activities. The data is stored in a database file and can be accessed from any activity.
