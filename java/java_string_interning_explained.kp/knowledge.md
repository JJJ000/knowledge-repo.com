## Definition
Java String interning is a technique used to store strings in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in a way that allows them to be quickly retrieved when needed. It is a type of memory management that reduces the amount of memory used by the JVM when creating and storing strings.

## Benefits
String interning can improve the performance of the JVM by reducing the amount of memory used to store strings. It also allows strings to be quickly retrieved when needed, which can improve the overall performance of the application. Additionally, strings that are interned can be compared using the == operator, which is faster than the equals() method.

## Implementation
String interning is implemented in the Java language by using the intern() method. This method creates a new string object in the JVM and returns a reference to it. All subsequent references to the same string will point to the same object in the JVM.

## Limitations
String interning is limited to strings that are created using the intern() method. Strings that are created using the new operator or string literals will not be interned. Additionally, strings that are created using the intern() method must be explicitly released from the JVM when they are no longer needed, otherwise they will remain in the JVM and consume memory.
