tldr: `mvn clean install` additionally deletes any files generated by prior builds, while `mvn install` only builds the project.

# What is Maven?
Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It provides a way to manage project builds, dependencies, and documentation.

# What is "mvn clean install"?
Maven's "mvn clean install" command is used to clean the project and then install the project and its dependencies. This command is typically used to build a project and create a jar file.

# What is "mvn install"?
Maven's "mvn install" command is used to install the project and its dependencies. This command is typically used to install a project and create a jar file.

# Difference between "mvn clean install" and "mvn install"
The main difference between "mvn clean install" and "mvn install" is that "mvn clean install" cleans the project before installing it, while "mvn install" only installs the project without cleaning it. This means that "mvn clean install" is often used to ensure the project is built from the most up-to-date source code, while "mvn install" is used to install an existing project.
