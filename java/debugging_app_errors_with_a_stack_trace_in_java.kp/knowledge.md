### What is a Stack Trace?
A stack trace is a report of the active stack frames at a certain point in time during the execution of a program. It lists the most recent method calls in the reverse order in which they were invoked, with the most recent call appearing first.

### How is a Stack Trace Used?
A stack trace is used to debug an application error by providing a trace of the code execution path that led to the error. It can be used to pinpoint the exact line of code that caused the error and help identify the root cause of the problem.

### How Can I Use a Stack Trace to Debug Java Errors?
When an error occurs in a Java program, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) will generate a stack trace that can be used to debug the error. The stack trace contains the method names, line numbers, and file names of the code that was executed when the error occurred. With this information, the programmer can identify the exact line of code that caused the error and take steps to fix it.

### Benefits of Using a Stack Trace
Using a stack trace to debug Java errors can save time and reduce frustration. It can help the programmer quickly identify the root cause of the problem and take corrective action. Additionally, it can help prevent similar errors from occurring in the future.
