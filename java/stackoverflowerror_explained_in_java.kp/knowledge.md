tldr: A StackOverflowError in Java is an error that occurs when the Java stack overflows due to a large number of method calls or infinite recursion.

### What is a StackOverflowError?
A StackOverflowError is an exception that occurs when the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) throws an error because it has run out of memory on the call stack. This error is usually caused by an infinite loop or a very large number of nested method calls.

### How Does it Occur?
A StackOverflowError occurs when the call stack size exceeds the amount of memory allocated for it. This can be caused by an infinite loop, a large number of nested method calls, or a recursive call of a method that never returns.

### How to Avoid it?
One way to avoid a StackOverflowError is to use an iterative approach instead of a recursive approach when writing code. Additionally, it is important to ensure that all methods have a base case, so that the recursive calls eventually stop. Finally, it is important to keep track of the number of nested method calls and ensure that the call stack does not exceed the amount of memory allocated for it.
