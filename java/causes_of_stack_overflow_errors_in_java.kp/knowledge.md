tldr: A Stack Overflow error in Java occurs when a method or constructor calls itself recursively, resulting in an infinite loop.

# Definition
A Stack Overflow error in Java occurs when a program attempts to use more memory space than the call stack has available. The call stack is a section of memory used to store information about the active subroutines of a program. When the call stack is full and no more memory is available, a Stack Overflow error occurs.

# Causes
A Stack Overflow error can be caused by several different things. These include:

1. Recursive functions that call themselves infinitely, without a base case.
2. Allocating too much memory on the stack, such as when large objects are declared inside a loop.
3. Unchecked exceptions that are not handled properly.
4. Poorly designed algorithms that require excessive memory usage.

# Prevention
A Stack Overflow error can be prevented by following best practices for programming in Java. These include:

1. Using a base case in recursive functions.
2. Limiting the amount of memory allocated on the stack.
3. Handling exceptions properly.
4. Designing algorithms to use memory efficiently.
