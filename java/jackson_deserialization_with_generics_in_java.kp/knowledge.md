tldr: Using the Jackson ObjectMapper, it is possible to deserialize a JSON string into a generic class by using the readValue() method.

## Section 1: Setting up the Generic Class

To deserialize a JSON object into a generic class in Java, you will need to set up a generic class that can be used to store the data. To do this, you will need to create a class with the generic type parameter, and then define the fields that will store the data from the JSON object.

For example:

```java
public class GenericClass<T> {
    private T data;
 
    public GenericClass(T data) {
        this.data = data;
    }
 
    public T getData() {
        return data;
    }
}
```

## Section 2: Deserializing the JSON Object

Once the generic class has been set up, the JSON object can be deserialized using the Jackson library. The Jackson library provides a number of methods for deserializing JSON objects into Java objects. To deserialize a JSON object into a generic class, you will need to use the `readValue` method.

This method takes two parameters: the JSON object and the generic class. For example:

```java
GenericClass<Object> genericClass = mapper.readValue(jsonObject, new TypeReference<GenericClass<Object>>(){});
```

## Section 3: Accessing the Data

Once the JSON object has been deserialized into the generic class, the data can be accessed using the `getData()` method. For example:

```java
Object data = genericClass.getData();
```

## Section 4: Using the Data

The data stored in the generic class can then be used as needed. Depending on the type of data, it may need to be cast to the appropriate type before it can be used. For example:

```java
String dataString = (String) data;
```
