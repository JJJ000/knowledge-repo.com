tldr: `This` should be used when referring to the current instance of a class within the class itself.

1. Using `this` to Refer to Instance Variables 
   - When writing a method within a class, `this` is used to refer to the instance variables of the class. This allows the method to distinguish between an instance variable and a parameter with the same name.

2. Using `this` to Invoke Constructors
   - `this` can also be used to invoke constructors within a class. This allows the constructor to be overloaded and called with different parameters.

3. Using `this` to Pass Arguments
   - `this` can be used to pass arguments to other methods within the same class. This allows the method to access the current instance of the class.

4. Using `this` to Return the Current Instance
   - `this` can also be used to return the current instance of the class. This is often used in fluent interfaces where the same instance is returned after a method has been called.
