tldr: Annotations are used in Java to provide additional information about the code, such as to define metadata, configure dependency injection, or to enable code-level behaviors, and are typically used in the source code or class files.

1. **What are Annotations?**
Annotations are syntactic metadata that can be added to Java source code. They provide data about a program that is not part of the program itself. Annotations have no direct effect on the operation of the code they annotate.

2. **Types of Annotations**
Annotations can be divided into two categories: built-in annotations and custom annotations. Built-in annotations are predefined annotations that are part of the Java language, such as @Override, @Deprecated and @SuppressWarnings. Custom annotations are user-defined annotations that can be used to provide additional information about a program.

3. **Uses of Annotations**
Annotations are used to provide additional information about a program, such as:
- Describing the purpose of a method
- Specifying the behavior of a method
- Defining the relationship between classes
- Providing information about the author of a class
- Assigning roles to classes or methods

4. **Where are Annotations Used?**
Annotations are most commonly used in Java programs to provide additional information about the code. They can be used in classes, methods, fields, parameters, and even packages. Annotations can also be used in XML configuration files and in JavaDoc comments.
