[TOC]

`**` Overview**

Yes, it is possible to declare a variable in Gradle that can be used in Java. Gradle is a build automation tool that can be used to manage and build Java projects. It provides a way to define variables that can be used in the build process, such as in tasks and scripts. These variables can also be used in Java code, as long as the variables are declared in a way that makes them accessible to Java.

`**` Declaring the Variable in Gradle**

In Gradle, variables can be declared with the ext property. This property is used to define a map of key-value pairs that can be used to store variables. The ext property is typically defined in the build.gradle file. For example, the following code declares a variable called “myVar” with a value of “foo”:

ext {
    myVar = "foo"
}

`**` Accessing the Variable in Java**

Once the variable has been declared in Gradle, it can be accessed in Java code. To do this, the Gradle API must be used to get the value of the variable. This can be done by using the Project.getExt() method, which returns a map of all the ext properties defined in the build.gradle file. The variable can then be retrieved from the map using its key. For example, the following code retrieves the value of the “myVar” variable declared above:

String myVarValue = (String) project.getExt().get("myVar");

`**` Conclusion**

In summary, it is possible to declare a variable in Gradle that can be used in Java. This is done by declaring the variable with the ext property in the build.gradle file, and then accessing the variable in Java code using the Project.getExt() method.
