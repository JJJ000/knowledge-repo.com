tldr: ThreadLocal variables should be used when you need to store thread-specific data that should not be shared between different threads.

### When To Use
A ThreadLocal variable should be used when a variable needs to be accessed by different threads, but each thread needs to have its own copy of the variable. This is useful when different threads need to access the same data, but the data needs to be modified in different ways for each thread.

### How To Use
Using a ThreadLocal variable is fairly simple. All that needs to be done is to create a new ThreadLocal instance, then assign a value to it. This value can then be accessed by any thread that has access to the ThreadLocal instance.

### Benefits
Using ThreadLocal variables can help to improve the performance of an application, as it reduces the need for synchronization between threads. It also makes it easier to manage data that needs to be shared between threads, as each thread has its own copy of the data.

### Drawbacks
Using ThreadLocal variables can lead to memory leaks, if the ThreadLocal instance is not properly managed. It is also not suitable for multi-threaded applications that require shared data, as each thread will have its own copy of the data.
