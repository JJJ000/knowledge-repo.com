### Java SE
Java SE (Standard Edition) is the basic version of the Java programming language. It provides a complete set of features for developing Java applications on desktops and servers. It includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), the Java compiler, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), and other core classes. It also includes the Java Development Kit (JDK), which contains the tools needed to develop Java applications.

### Java EE
Java EE (Enterprise Edition) is an extended version of Java SE that provides additional features for developing enterprise applications. It includes APIs for distributed computing, web-based applications, and database access. It also includes technologies such as Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB), JavaServer Pages (JSP), and JavaServer Faces (JSF).

### Java ME
Java ME (Micro Edition) is a version of Java designed for mobile devices and embedded systems. It includes a subset of the Java SE APIs and a set of APIs specific to mobile and embedded platforms. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, and it supports features such as low-memory devices, limited network connectivity, and limited user interfaces.
