#### Class.isInstance
`Class.isInstance` is a method that checks if a given object is an instance of a certain class. It takes one parameter, the object to be checked, and returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the object is an instance of the class.

#### Class.isAssignableFrom
`Class.isAssignableFrom` is a method that checks if a given class is assignable from another class. It takes one parameter, the class to be checked, and returns a boolean value indicating whether or not the class is assignable from the other class.

#### Difference
The main difference between the two methods is that `Class.isInstance` checks if an object is an instance of a class, while `Class.isAssignableFrom` checks if a class is assignable from another class.
