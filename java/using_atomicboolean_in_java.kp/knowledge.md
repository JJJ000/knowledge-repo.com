tldr: AtomicBoolean should be used when multiple threads need to access and modify a boolean variable concurrently.

1. What is AtomicBoolean?
AtomicBoolean is a special type of boolean variable in Java. It is used to ensure that only one thread can access a shared boolean variable at any given time. It is part of the java.util.concurrent package and provides thread safety for boolean operations.

2. When to use AtomicBoolean?
AtomicBoolean is used when multiple threads need to access a shared boolean variable and ensure that only one thread can access the variable at any given time. This is especially useful in multi-threaded applications where different threads need to access and modify the same boolean variable.

3. How to use AtomicBoolean?
AtomicBoolean can be used in the following ways:
• Use the AtomicBoolean class’s get() and set() methods to read and write the boolean variable.
• Use the compareAndSet() method to atomically set the boolean variable if it matches a given value.
• Use the getAndSet() method to atomically set the boolean variable and return the old value.

4. Benefits of using AtomicBoolean
AtomicBoolean provides thread safety and ensures that only one thread can access the boolean variable at any given time. This helps to prevent race conditions and deadlocks in multi-threaded applications. AtomicBoolean also provides the ability to atomically set the boolean variable, which helps to ensure that the value is always consistent.
