tldr: In Java, `implements` is used to implement an interface, while `extends` is used to extend a class; the difference is that an interface only defines the method signatures while a class provides the implementation for the methods.

### Implements
Implements is a keyword used in Java to indicate that a class is implementing an interface. It is used when a class wants to inherit the abstract methods of an interface.

### Extends
Extends is a keyword used in Java to indicate that a class is extending a class. It is used when a class wants to inherit the properties and methods of another class.

### Difference
The main difference between implements and extends is that implements is used to implement an interface while extends is used to extend a class. An interface can only extend another interface while a class can extend another class or implement an interface.

### When to Use
Implements should be used when you want to inherit the abstract methods of an interface. Extends should be used when you want to inherit the properties and methods of a class.
