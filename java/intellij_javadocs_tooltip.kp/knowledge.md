### Yes
IntelliJ can show JavaDocs tooltip on mouse over. This can be done by enabling the setting `Editor > General > Code Completion > Autopopup code completion on a caret stop`.

### How
To enable the setting, follow the steps below:

1. Go to `Editor > General > Code Completion`.
2. Check the box for `Autopopup code completion on a caret stop`.
3. Click `OK` to save the changes.

### Result
After enabling the setting, when the mouse is hovered over a Java class, IntelliJ will show a tooltip containing the JavaDocs for that class. This can be useful for quickly looking up the documentation for a class without having to search for it.
