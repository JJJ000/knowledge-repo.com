[TOC]

#### Section 1: Overview
Gson is a Java library that can be used to convert a JSON string to a typed ArrayList. Gson is a popular open source library from Google that can be used to serialize and deserialize Java objects to and from JSON.

#### Section 2: Setup
In order to use Gson, you must first include the Gson library in your project. This can be done by adding the following line to your `build.gradle` file:

```
implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.5'
```

#### Section 3: Usage
Once Gson is setup, you can use the `fromJson()` method to convert a JSON string to a typed ArrayList. The following example shows how to convert a JSON string to an ArrayList of type `String`:

```
Gson gson = new Gson();
String jsonString = "[\"foo\", \"bar\"]";

Type listType = new TypeToken<ArrayList<String>>(){}.getType();
ArrayList<String> list = gson.fromJson(jsonString, listType);
```

#### Section 4: Conclusion
Gson is a powerful library that can be used to easily convert JSON strings to typed ArrayLists in Java. By following the steps outlined in this article, you can quickly and easily convert JSON strings to typed ArrayLists.
