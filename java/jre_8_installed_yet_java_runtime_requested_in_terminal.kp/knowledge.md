# Reason

The error message "No Java Runtime present, requesting to install" is displayed when a Java application is run without a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). This means that the application is unable to find a valid JRE on the computer.

# JRE 8 Installation

JRE 8 is available for download from the Oracle website and can be installed on a Mac. However, the error message may still be displayed if the application is not configured to look for the JRE in the correct location.

# Troubleshooting

If the error message is still displayed after installing JRE 8, it is likely that the application is not configured to look for the JRE in the correct location. To troubleshoot this issue, the application should be checked to make sure that it is configured to look for the JRE in the correct location.
