tldr: The most efficient way to increment a Map value in Java is to use the compute() method.

`**` Initializing the Map**

The first step is to initialize the Map. This can be done by creating a new Map object and adding elements to it. For example,

```
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
map.put("a", 0);
map.put("b", 0);
```

`**` Incrementing the Value**

To increment the value of a specific key, we can use the `compute` method of the Map interface. This method takes the key as an argument and a function as the second argument. The function will be applied to the value associated with the key and the result will be stored in the Map.

For example, to increment the value of "a" by one, we can use the following code:

```
map.compute("a", (key, value) -> value + 1);
```

`**` Using a Counter**

Alternatively, we can use a counter to increment the value of the Map. This is done by creating a counter variable and incrementing it each time the Map is updated.

For example,

```
int counter = 0;
map.put("a", counter++);
map.put("b", counter++);
```

`**` Using AtomicInteger**

We can also use the `AtomicInteger` class to increment the value of the Map. This class provides a `getAndIncrement()` method which can be used to atomically increment the value of the Map.

For example,

```
AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger();
map.put("a", counter.getAndIncrement());
map.put("b", counter.getAndIncrement());
```
