# Section 1: Understanding the Error
The "java.net.BindException: Address already in use: JVM_Bind" error occurs when a process attempts to bind to a port that is already in use. This means that the process is trying to use a port that another process is already using.

# Section 2: Identifying the Process
In order to resolve this error, the first step is to identify the process that is already using the port. This can be done using the command line tool `netstat`. This command will list all the ports that are currently in use and the process that is using them.

# Section 3: Killing the Process
Once the process has been identified, it can be killed using the command line tool `kill`. This will stop the process and free up the port for use by the process that is throwing the error.

# Section 4: Troubleshooting
If the error persists after killing the process, it is possible that another process is using the same port. This can be checked using the `netstat` command. If another process is using the port, it can be killed and the error should be resolved.
