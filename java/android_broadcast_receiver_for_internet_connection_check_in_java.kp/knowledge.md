# Section 1: Overview
Broadcast receivers are components of an Android app that respond to system-wide broadcast announcements. Broadcast receivers allow apps to register for particular system events and then respond to them when they occur. In this case, we are looking at a broadcast receiver that can be used to check for an internet connection in an Android app.

# Section 2: Setting Up the Broadcast Receiver
The first step in setting up the broadcast receiver is to create a BroadcastReceiver class. This class should extend the BroadcastReceiver class and must override the onReceive() method. This method will be called when the broadcast is received.

# Section 3: Checking the Connection
Inside the onReceive() method, we can check for an internet connection by using the ConnectivityManager class. This class provides access to the device's active network connection, allowing us to check if the device is connected to the internet or not.

# Section 4: Responding to the Connection
Once we have determined if the device is connected to the internet or not, we can take the appropriate action. This could include displaying a message to the user, or taking some other action such as disabling certain features in the app.
