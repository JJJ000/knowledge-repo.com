### Percent Encoding

The most common method of encoding query string parameters is called percent encoding. This involves replacing any special characters in the parameter with a URL-encoded version of the character. For example, a space character is replaced with `%20`, an exclamation mark is replaced with `%21`, and a plus sign is replaced with `%2B`.

### Character Encoding

Another method of encoding query string parameters is to use a specific character encoding. This involves converting the parameter into a specific character set, such as UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1. This ensures that the parameter is properly encoded and can be safely transmitted over the web.

### HTML Encoding

HTML encoding is another method of encoding query string parameters. This involves replacing any special characters in the parameter with HTML-encoded versions of the character. For example, a space character is replaced with `&#32;`, an exclamation mark is replaced with `&#33;`, and a plus sign is replaced with `&#43;`.

### URL Encoding

URL encoding is a combination of percent encoding, character encoding, and HTML encoding. This method of encoding query string parameters ensures that all special characters are properly encoded and can be safely transmitted over the web.
