### Explanation

Math.round() is a method used in Java to round a number to the nearest integer. In this case, the number 0.49999999999999994 is close to 0.5, so Math.round() will return 1.

### How Math.round() Works

Math.round() works by taking the number given and comparing it to 0.5. If the number is less than 0.5, it will round down to the nearest integer. If the number is greater than 0.5, it will round up to the nearest integer. 

### Example

For example, Math.round(0.3) will return 0, because 0.3 is less than 0.5. On the other hand, Math.round(0.7) will return 1, because 0.7 is greater than 0.5.
