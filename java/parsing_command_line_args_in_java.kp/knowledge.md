tldr: The easiest way to parse command line arguments in Java is to use the String[] args parameter in the main method.

### Using Apache Commons CLI
Apache Commons CLI is a library that can be used to parse command line arguments in Java. It provides a simple API to parse command line options, such as flags, arguments, and parameters. The library provides an easy-to-use API that allows developers to quickly and easily parse command line arguments.

### Creating an Options Object
The first step in using Apache Commons CLI is to create an Options object. This object will contain all of the command line options that the program should recognize. Each option is specified with an Option object, which can be configured with various parameters, such as the name of the option, a description, and whether or not it is required.

### Parsing Command Line Arguments
Once the Options object has been created, the program can parse the command line arguments using the parse() method. This method takes a String array containing the command line arguments, as well as the Options object, and returns a CommandLine object. The CommandLine object contains all of the parsed options and arguments, which can then be accessed through various methods.

### Accessing Parsed Options
Once the CommandLine object has been created, the parsed options and arguments can be accessed through various methods. The getOptionValue() method can be used to get the value of a specific option, while the getArgList() method can be used to get a list of all of the arguments passed in. The CommandLine object also provides methods for determining if an option was specified, as well as for printing out the parsed options and arguments.
