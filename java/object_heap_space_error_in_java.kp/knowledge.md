### Explanation
When attempting to reserve space for the object heap in Java, there are several factors which can prevent the space from being reserved. The most common of these is that the amount of memory requested is larger than the amount of memory available on the system. Additionally, the system may not have enough contiguous memory to reserve the requested amount, which can also prevent the space from being reserved.

### Possible Solutions
The first step to resolving this issue is to determine the amount of memory available on the system. This can be done by running the `free` command in a terminal window. Once the total amount of memory available is determined, it can be compared to the amount requested by the Java application. If the amount requested is larger than the amount available, the application should be modified to reduce the amount of memory requested.

The second step is to determine if the system has enough contiguous memory to reserve the requested amount. This can be done by running the `top` command and looking at the "free" memory listed. If there is not enough contiguous memory available, the application can be modified to request a smaller amount of memory.

### Conclusion
In summary, when attempting to reserve space for the object heap in Java, it is important to ensure that there is enough memory available on the system and that the system has enough contiguous memory to reserve the requested amount. If either of these conditions are not met, the application should be modified to reduce the amount of memory requested.
