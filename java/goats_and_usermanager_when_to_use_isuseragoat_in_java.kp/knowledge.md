### Animal Identification
This use case is designed to identify animals, particularly goats, that are interacting with the Android application. By using the `UserManager.isUserAGoat()` method, the application can determine whether the user is a goat or not. This can be used to provide tailored content to the user, or to restrict certain features of the application to only goats.

### Data Collection
This use case is designed to collect data on the interactions between goats and the application. By using the `UserManager.isUserAGoat()` method, the application can track the number of goats that have interacted with it. This data can be used to measure the success of the application or to inform future development decisions.

### Security
This use case is designed to provide an additional layer of security to the application. By using the `UserManager.isUserAGoat()` method, the application can determine whether the user is a goat or not. This can be used to restrict certain features of the application to only goats, or to require additional authentication steps for goats.

### User Experience
This use case is designed to improve the user experience for goats. By using the `UserManager.isUserAGoat()` method, the application can provide tailored content to goats or provide additional features or services for them. This can be used to improve the overall user experience for goats, making the application more appealing to them.
