## Overview

IntelliJ is an integrated development environment (IDE) used for software development. It is used to develop applications using various programming languages, frameworks, and technologies. IntelliJ is a popular choice among developers due to its powerful features and ease of use.

However, when using IntelliJ, users may encounter an error saying "Error:java: error: release version 5 not supported". This error occurs when the version of Java being used is not supported by IntelliJ.

## Causes

This error is caused by using an unsupported version of Java. IntelliJ only supports certain versions of Java, and if the version being used is not one of these supported versions, the error will occur.

## Solutions

The best way to resolve this error is to upgrade to a supported version of Java. IntelliJ supports Java 8 and later, so if the version of Java being used is older than this, it should be upgraded to the latest version.

Alternatively, if the version of Java being used is already supported by IntelliJ, the error may be caused by a misconfiguration. In this case, the IntelliJ configuration should be checked and any incorrect settings should be corrected.
