### Searching for the Class

The first step to finding a class inside a JAR file is to use a tool like `jar tf` to list the contents of the JAR file. This command can be used to search for specific classes inside the JAR file.

### Using Java Decompiler

Once the class is found, the next step is to use a Java decompiler to view the source code of the class. There are a number of Java decompilers available, such as JD-GUI and JAD. These tools can be used to open the JAR file and view the source code of the class.

### Analyzing the Source Code

Once the source code of the class is available, it can be analyzed to determine its purpose and any other relevant information. This can be done by studying the code and looking for any relevant information, such as variables, methods, and classes.

### Finalizing the Search

Once the class is found and the source code is analyzed, the search can be finalized. This can be done by checking the documentation of the JAR file to make sure the class is the one being sought. After this, the class can be used as needed.
