tldr: A static nested class in Java allows for better organization of related classes and for keeping similar code together in one place.

# What is a Static Nested Class?
A static nested class is a type of inner class in Java. It is a static member of the outer class and can be accessed without creating an instance of the outer class. It can have static as well as non-static members.

# Benefits of a Static Nested Class
1. Encapsulation: A static nested class can be used to encapsulate the implementation details of a class, thus providing a more organized and maintainable code.
2. Memory Management: A static nested class does not require the outer class to be instantiated and thus can be used to reduce memory usage.
3. Access Control: A static nested class can be used to restrict access to certain members of the outer class.

# When to Use a Static Nested Class
A static nested class should be used when it is necessary to logically group classes that are only used in one place. It should also be used when a class requires access control, and when memory management is a concern.
