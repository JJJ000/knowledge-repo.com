### Introduction

A thread pool is a set of threads that can be used to execute tasks. It is a way of managing multiple threads, providing a pool of threads that can be used to execute tasks. Thread pools are used to improve performance by reducing the overhead associated with creating and destroying threads for each task.

### Benefits of Using Thread Pools

Using thread pools can provide a number of benefits, including:

- Increased performance: Thread pools can help improve performance by reusing threads that have already been created, rather than creating new threads for each task.

- Reduced resource consumption: Thread pools can help reduce the amount of memory and other resources consumed by creating and destroying threads for each task.

- Improved scalability: Thread pools can help improve scalability by allowing tasks to be executed in parallel.

### Java 8 Parallel Streams

Java 8 introduced the concept of parallel streams, which allow tasks to be executed in parallel. Parallel streams use a thread pool to execute tasks in parallel, and the size of the thread pool can be configured.

### Custom Thread Pool in Java 8 Parallel Streams

It is possible to create a custom thread pool in Java 8 parallel streams. This can be done by using the ForkJoinPool class, which allows a custom thread pool to be created and configured. This allows the size of the thread pool to be configured, which can help improve performance and scalability.
