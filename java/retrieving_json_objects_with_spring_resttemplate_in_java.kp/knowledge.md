## Section 1: Set Up

Before you can use the Spring RestTemplate to get a list of JSON objects, you will need to set up the RestTemplate. To do this, you will need to create a RestTemplate instance, set the base URL for the endpoint you are targeting, and set the HttpMessageConverter to use for parsing the response.

## Section 2: Executing the Request

Once the RestTemplate is set up, you can execute the request by calling the `getForObject()` method. This method takes the URL of the endpoint as its first argument, and the type of the response as its second argument. In this case, the response type should be a `List<Object>`.

## Section 3: Parsing the Response

The response will be parsed using the HttpMessageConverter that was set when the RestTemplate was created. The response will be converted into a List of objects, which can then be used as needed.

## Section 4: Handling Errors

If the request fails, the RestTemplate will throw an exception. It is important to catch this exception and handle it appropriately. This can be done by using a `try-catch` block, or by using the `getForEntity()` method, which returns the response as an `HttpEntity`. This allows you to check the status code of the response and handle errors accordingly.
