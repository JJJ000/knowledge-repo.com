[TOC]

# Section 1 - Definition
An associative array (also known as a map, dictionary, or hash) is a data structure that stores a collection of key-value pairs. It is an unordered collection of objects in which each object is associated with a unique key.

# Section 2 - Advantages
The main advantage of an associative array is that it allows for fast lookups and provides an efficient way to store and retrieve data. It is also an efficient way to store and retrieve data because the key can be used to directly access the associated value.

# Section 3 - Disadvantages
The main disadvantage of an associative array is that it is not ordered. This means that the elements of the array are not stored in any particular order and cannot be accessed in a predictable way.

# Section 4 - Usage in Java
In Java, associative arrays are implemented using the Map interface. The Map interface provides methods for adding, removing, and retrieving key-value pairs. The most commonly used implementation of the Map interface is the HashMap class. The HashMap class provides an efficient way to store and retrieve data using a unique key.
