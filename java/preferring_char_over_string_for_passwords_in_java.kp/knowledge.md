### Security

The primary reason char[] is preferred over String for passwords in Java is security. Strings are immutable, meaning that once a String is created, it can't be changed. This means that the password is stored in memory, making it vulnerable to attack. By using char[] instead of String, the password can be cleared from memory as soon as it is used.

### Performance

Another benefit of using char[] is improved performance. Strings take up more memory than char[] and are slower to process. This can be a critical factor when dealing with sensitive information like passwords.

### Flexibility

Using char[] instead of String also allows for greater flexibility. With char[] you can use a variety of data types, including integers and booleans. This allows for a more secure and efficient way to store passwords.

### Compatibility

Finally, char[] is preferred over String because it is more compatible with other languages. Many languages, such as C and C++, use char[] for passwords. This allows for easier portability of code between languages.
