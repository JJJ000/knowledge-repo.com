#1 Using the Date class
The Date class in Java provides a number of methods to compare dates. 

### 1.1 Using before() and after()
The before() and after() methods can be used to compare two dates. The before() method returns true if the date on which it is invoked is before the date passed as a parameter. Similarly, the after() method returns true if the date on which it is invoked is after the date passed as a parameter.

### 1.2 Using compareTo()
The compareTo() method can be used to compare two dates. The compareTo() method returns a negative number if the date on which it is invoked is before the date passed as a parameter. It returns a positive number if the date on which it is invoked is after the date passed as a parameter. It returns 0 if both the dates are equal.

#2 Using the Calendar class
The Calendar class in Java provides a number of methods to compare dates. 

### 2.1 Using before() and after()
The before() and after() methods can be used to compare two dates. The before() method returns true if the date on which it is invoked is before the date passed as a parameter. Similarly, the after() method returns true if the date on which it is invoked is after the date passed as a parameter.

### 2.2 Using compareTo()
The compareTo() method can be used to compare two dates. The compareTo() method returns a negative number if the date on which it is invoked is before the date passed as a parameter. It returns a positive number if the date on which it is invoked is after the date passed as a parameter. It returns 0 if both the dates are equal.

### 2.3 Using getTimeInMillis()
The getTimeInMillis() method can be used to compare two dates. The getTimeInMillis() method returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 for the date on which it is invoked. The two dates can be compared by comparing the values returned by the getTimeInMillis() method. If the value returned by the first date is less than the value returned by the second date, then the first date is before the second date. Similarly, if the value returned by the first date is greater than the value returned by the second date, then the first date is after the second date.
