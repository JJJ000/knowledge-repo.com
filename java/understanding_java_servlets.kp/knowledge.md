### What is a Servlet?
A servlet is a Java class that is used to extend the functionality of a web server. It provides a way to generate dynamic content, process and store data, and interact with databases.

### How Servlets Work
Servlets are written in Java and compiled into Java bytecode. When a request is made to the web server, the servlet is invoked and the request is processed. The servlet can access the server’s resources, such as databases and files, and generate a response. The response is usually an HTML page, but it can also be an XML document, a PDF file, or an image.

### Benefits of Using Servlets
Servlets are more efficient than CGI scripts, as they are compiled and loaded only once, and all requests are handled by the same process. This makes them faster and more reliable. Servlets also provide better security, as they run within the web server’s secure environment. Finally, servlets are platform-independent, as they are written in Java, which is supported on all major operating systems.

### Conclusion
Servlets are an ideal solution for developing dynamic web applications. They are secure, efficient, and platform-independent. They also provide a powerful way to access server resources, such as databases and files.
