tldr: When implementing an interface, it is generally good practice to name the class with the suffix `Impl` appended to the interface name.

### Naming Convention

### Interfaces
Interfaces should be named with an adjective that describes the behavior it encapsulates. The name should be a noun or noun phrase and should not contain any abbreviations.

### Implementations
Implementations should be named with the same noun or noun phrase as the interface, followed by an adjective or phrase that describes the particular implementation. The name should not contain any abbreviations.
