[TOC]

# Section 1: package.html

package.html is an HTML file which contains a description of a Java package. It is usually located in the root directory of a package, and is displayed by the Java API documentation generator (javadoc). This file is used to provide a high-level overview of the package, including its purpose, classes, methods, and other related information.

# Section 2: package-info.java

package-info.java is a Java source file which contains a description of a Java package. It is usually located in the root directory of a package, and is displayed by the Java API documentation generator (javadoc). This file is used to provide a high-level overview of the package, including its purpose, classes, methods, and other related information.

# Section 3: Advantages of package-info.java

One of the main advantages of package-info.java is that it allows for more control over the formatting of the package documentation. This is because the documentation is written in Java code, rather than in HTML. Additionally, package-info.java provides the ability to add annotations to the package documentation, which can be used to provide additional information about the package.

# Section 4: Advantages of package.html

One of the main advantages of package.html is that it is easier to write and edit than package-info.java. This is because the documentation is written in HTML, which is a more user-friendly language than Java. Additionally, package.html provides the ability to add images and other multimedia elements to the package documentation.
