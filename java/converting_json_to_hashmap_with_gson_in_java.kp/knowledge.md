tldr: You can convert JSON to a HashMap using Gson in Java by calling the fromJson() method on the Gson object.

### Add Gson Dependency

In order to use Gson, you will need to add the Gson dependency to your project. This can be done by adding the following line to your ```build.gradle``` file:

```
implementation 'com.google.code.gson:gson:2.8.6'
```

### Create Gson Object

Once the Gson dependency is added, you can create a Gson object to convert the JSON string to a HashMap. This can be done by using the following code:

```
Gson gson = new Gson();
```

### Convert JSON to HashMap

Now that you have a Gson object, you can use it to convert the JSON string to a HashMap. This can be done by using the following code:

```
HashMap<String, Object> map = gson.fromJson(jsonString, new TypeToken<HashMap<String, Object>>(){}.getType());
```

### Use the HashMap

Once the JSON string has been converted to a HashMap, you can use the HashMap as you would any other HashMap. For example, you can access the values in the HashMap by using the following code:

```
Object value = map.get("key");
```
