tldr: Servlets can be used to handle requests from the client-side (Ajax) and respond with dynamic data.

1. ## Setting Up a Servlet
A servlet is a Java class that runs on a web server and processes requests from clients. To use servlets in a Java application, you need to set up a servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat. The servlet container will provide the environment for your servlet to run.

2. ## Implementing the Servlet
Once the servlet container is set up, you can create a servlet class. This class should extend the `HttpServlet` class and override the `doGet` and `doPost` methods. The `doGet` method is used to process GET requests from the client, while the `doPost` method is used to process POST requests.

3. ## Using Ajax
Ajax (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique used to make asynchronous web requests from the client to the server. To use Ajax with a servlet, you need to create an Ajax call from the client side. This call should send an HTTP request to the servlet, which will then process the request and return a response.

4. ## Handling the Response
Once the servlet has processed the request, it will return a response to the client. This response can be in the form of an XML, JSON, or HTML document. The client can then use this response to update the page or take some other action.
