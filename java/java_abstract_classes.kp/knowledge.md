tldr: An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated and must be extended by another class.

# Definition 
An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated and contains abstract methods. Abstract classes are used as a template for other classes to extend and implement the abstract methods.

# Usage
Abstract classes are used to provide a common definition of a base class that multiple derived classes can share. This allows for code reuse and avoids duplication. Abstract classes also allow for the implementation of polymorphism, as derived classes can be used interchangeably.

# Benefits
Abstract classes provide a way to share code between multiple classes, which reduces the amount of code needed to be written and maintained. They also provide a way to enforce a common behavior among derived classes, as derived classes must implement the abstract methods.

# Example
For example, an abstract class called Animal can be created with an abstract method called makeSound(). The derived classes Dog and Cat can then extend the Animal class and implement the makeSound() method. The Dog class can then implement the makeSound() method to return "woof" and the Cat class can implement the makeSound() method to return "meow".
