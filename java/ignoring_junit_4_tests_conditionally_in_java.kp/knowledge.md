### Overview

JUnit 4 is a popular Java-based testing framework used to write and run repeatable automated tests. It provides a number of features to help developers write effective tests, including the ability to conditionally ignore tests. This allows developers to skip certain tests in certain conditions, such as when a certain dependency is not available or when a certain environment is not present.

### Using the @Ignore Annotation

The most common way to conditionally ignore tests in JUnit 4 is to use the @Ignore annotation. This annotation can be applied to a test method or a test class and will cause the test to be skipped when the test is run. The annotation can also be used to provide an optional message that will be displayed when the test is skipped.

### Using the Assume Class

Another way to conditionally ignore tests in JUnit 4 is to use the Assume class. This class provides a number of methods that can be used to skip tests based on certain conditions. For example, the assumeTrue() method can be used to skip a test if a certain condition is not met.

### Summary

In summary, JUnit 4 provides a number of ways to conditionally ignore tests. The @Ignore annotation can be used to skip tests, as well as the Assume class, which provides a number of methods for skipping tests based on certain conditions.
