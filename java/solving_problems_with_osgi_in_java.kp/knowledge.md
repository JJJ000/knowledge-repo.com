[TOC]

1. **Modularity**
OSGi provides a modular platform for Java applications, allowing developers to create, deploy, and maintain applications composed of loosely coupled components. OSGi enables developers to create applications that can be dynamically updated and reconfigured without the need for a full application restart. 

2. **Dynamic Class Loading**
OSGi provides dynamic class loading, allowing applications to load and unload classes while the application is running. This feature allows developers to deploy new versions of an application without having to restart the entire application.

3. **Service-Oriented Architecture**
OSGi provides a service-oriented architecture, allowing applications to be composed of multiple services that can be dynamically discovered, configured, and managed. This allows developers to create applications that can be easily reconfigured and updated without the need for a full application restart.

4. **Version Management**
OSGi provides version management, allowing developers to manage multiple versions of an application and its components. This allows applications to be deployed and updated without having to restart the entire application.
