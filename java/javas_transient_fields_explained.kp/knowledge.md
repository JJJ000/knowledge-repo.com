### Purpose
The purpose of transient fields is to indicate that the field should not be serialized when an object is stored. This is useful when an object is serialized to a file, sent over a network, or stored in a database.

### Benefits
By using transient fields, developers can avoid storing unnecessary data and reduce the size of the serialized object. This can help improve the performance of applications that rely on serialization. Additionally, transient fields can help protect sensitive data, such as passwords, from being stored in plain text.

### Limitations
Transient fields cannot be used to store data that needs to be preserved across different instances of an object. Additionally, transient fields cannot be used to store data in a database, as databases typically do not support the concept of transient fields.
