### Overview

Java reflection is a powerful tool that allows us to access and modify private static final fields. This can be done by using the Field class from the java.lang.reflect package.

### Getting the Field

The first step is to get a reference to the Field object. This can be done using the getDeclaredField method of the Class class. This method takes the name of the field as an argument and returns a Field object that can be used to access the field.

### Accessing the Field

Once we have a reference to the Field object, we can use the setAccessible method to make the field accessible. This will allow us to access and modify the field.

### Modifying the Field

Finally, we can use the set method of the Field class to modify the value of the field. This method takes two arguments â€“ the object that contains the field and the new value for the field.
