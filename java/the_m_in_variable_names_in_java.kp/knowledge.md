# Common Convention

It is a common convention in Java to start variable names with the letter 'm'. This is done to denote a class-level variable (member variable) in the code. This helps to distinguish between class-level variables and local variables.

# Improved Readability

Starting variable names with the letter 'm' can improve readability in the code. This is because it is easier to distinguish between class-level variables and local variables when they are named differently.

# Consistency

Using the same convention for all class-level variables helps to maintain consistency in the code. This makes it easier to read and understand the code, as well as to debug any issues.

# Easier to Find

Starting variable names with the letter 'm' also makes it easier to find class-level variables in the code. This is because all class-level variables will be grouped together, making it easier to find them when needed.
