## Solution 1: Use OpenSessionInView
OpenSessionInView is a pattern that is used to keep the Hibernate Session open during the entire request processing lifecycle. This allows the lazy loading of the associated entities without the need to manually open and close the Session.

## Solution 2: Fetch Data Eagerly
Another solution is to fetch the data eagerly, instead of lazily. This means that the associated entities are fetched when the parent entity is fetched, instead of when they are first accessed. This can be done by using the FetchType.EAGER annotation in the mapping.

## Solution 3: Use Fetch Profiles
Fetch profiles allow you to define different fetch strategies for different parts of the application. This means that you can define a fetch strategy for the parts of the application that require eager loading, and use the default lazy loading strategy for the parts that don't require it.

## Solution 4: Use a Stateless Session
A stateless session is a Hibernate session that does not maintain any state between requests. This means that the associated entities are fetched when they are first accessed, instead of when the parent entity is fetched. This can be done by using the StatelessSession interface.
