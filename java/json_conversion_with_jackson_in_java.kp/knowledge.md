# Introduction

Java objects can be converted to JSON using the Jackson library. Jackson is a popular JSON processing library for Java that provides a simple and efficient way to convert Java objects to JSON and vice versa.

# How to Use Jackson

Using Jackson is relatively straightforward. First, you need to add the Jackson library to your project. This can be done using Maven or Gradle.

Once the Jackson library is included in your project, you can use the ObjectMapper class to convert Java objects to JSON. The ObjectMapper class has several methods that can be used to convert a Java object to JSON, such as writeValueAsString() and writeValueAsBytes().

# Serializing Java Objects

When serializing Java objects to JSON, Jackson will convert the object’s fields to JSON properties. It will also convert the object’s methods to JSON properties, but these will not be included in the output.

In addition, Jackson will also convert certain Java types to their corresponding JSON types. For example, a java.util.Date object will be converted to a JSON string, and a java.math.BigDecimal object will be converted to a JSON number.

# Deserializing JSON

Deserializing JSON is the process of converting JSON back into Java objects. This can be done using the ObjectMapper class as well. The readValue() method can be used to deserialize a JSON string or byte array into a Java object. The readValue() method takes two arguments: the JSON string or byte array and the type of the Java object to be deserialized.
