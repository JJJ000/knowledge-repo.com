### Using String Constructor

The simplest way to convert a char array back to a string is by using the String constructor. This constructor takes an array of characters as an argument and returns a string representation of the characters.

### Using StringBuilder

Another way to convert a char array back to a string is by using the StringBuilder class. The StringBuilder class has a constructor that takes an array of characters as an argument. The constructor then builds a string from the characters in the array.

### Using for Loop

We can also use a for loop to convert a char array back to a string. In this approach, we iterate through the array and append each character to a String object.

### Using Streams

Finally, we can use the Streams API to convert a char array back to a string. The Streams API provides a mapToObj() method that takes a char array and returns a Stream of Strings. We can then use the collect() method to collect the Stream of Strings into a single String.
