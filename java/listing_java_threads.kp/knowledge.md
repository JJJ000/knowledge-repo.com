1. How to Obtain a List of Threads
---------------------------------
The easiest way to obtain a list of threads currently running in Java is to use the `Thread.getAllStackTraces()` method. This method returns a `Map` containing a list of all live threads and their stack traces.

2. Example Usage
----------------
The following code snippet demonstrates how to use the `Thread.getAllStackTraces()` method to obtain a list of threads currently running in Java:

```
Map<Thread, StackTraceElement[]> threadMap = Thread.getAllStackTraces();
for (Thread thread : threadMap.keySet()) {
    System.out.println("Thread: " + thread.getName());
}
```

3. Additional Information
-------------------------
It is important to note that the `Thread.getAllStackTraces()` method is a static method and does not require an instance of the `Thread` class to be created. Additionally, the `Map` returned by this method contains all live threads, including daemon threads and threads that have been terminated.

4. Conclusion
-------------
The `Thread.getAllStackTraces()` method is the easiest way to obtain a list of threads currently running in Java. This method returns a `Map` containing all live threads and their stack traces, which can then be used to analyze the current state of the application.
