1. Shared Preferences 
Shared Preferences is the most common way to store user settings in Android applications. It is a key-value storage system that stores data in XML files on the device. It is a lightweight API that can be used to store primitive data such as strings, integers, and booleans.

2. SQLite Database 
Another way to store user settings in Android applications is to use a SQLite database. This is a more robust solution than Shared Preferences as it allows for complex data structures and relationships to be stored. It can also be used to store user preferences in a structured way.

3. File Storage 
File storage is another way to store user settings in Android applications. It is a more advanced solution than Shared Preferences or SQLite as it allows for more complex data structures and relationships to be stored. It is also more secure as the data is stored in a file on the device rather than in an XML file.

4. Cloud Storage 
Cloud storage is another option for storing user settings in Android applications. It is a more secure and reliable solution as the data is stored in the cloud rather than on the device. It also allows for the data to be accessed from multiple devices.
