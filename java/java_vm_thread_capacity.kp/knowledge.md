1. Maximum Threads 
   Java Virtual Machines can support up to 2^32 threads.

2. Limitations 
   The actual number of threads that can be supported is limited by the operating system and hardware.

3. Memory 
   The amount of memory available to the JVM will also affect the number of threads that can be supported.

4. Thread Scheduling 
   The thread scheduling algorithm used by the JVM can also affect the number of threads that can be supported.
