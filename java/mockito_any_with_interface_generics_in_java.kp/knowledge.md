#### Yes 
Mockito.any() can be used to pass an Interface with Generics in Java. It can be used to match any type of argument, including generics.

#### Example 
For example, the following code shows how to use Mockito.any() to pass an interface with generics:

```
MyInterface<String> myInterface = Mockito.mock(MyInterface.class);
when(myInterface.someMethod(Mockito.any())).thenReturn("some value");
```

#### Advantages 
Using Mockito.any() has several advantages. It allows the code to be more flexible and easier to maintain. It also allows for more efficient testing, as it eliminates the need to manually specify the type of argument.

#### Disadvantages 
The main disadvantage of using Mockito.any() is that it can make the code less readable. It can also be difficult to debug if something goes wrong, as it is not always easy to determine which type of argument is being passed.
