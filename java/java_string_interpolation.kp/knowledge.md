# Introduction

Variable interpolation is a process of replacing variables with their corresponding values in a program. This process is used in many programming languages, including Java. In Java, variable interpolation is used to insert values into strings.

# String Interpolation

In Java, variable interpolation is done using the String.format() method. This method takes a string as an argument and replaces the variables in the string with their corresponding values. The variables are specified using the %s format. For example, the following code will replace the variable "name" with the value "John":

String name = "John";
String message = String.format("Hello %s", name);

# Other Interpolation Methods

In addition to using the String.format() method, there are other methods for variable interpolation in Java. One of the most common is using the + operator. This method takes two strings and concatenates them together. For example, the following code will replace the variable "name" with the value "John":

String name = "John";
String message = "Hello " + name;

# Conclusion

Variable interpolation is an important part of programming in Java. It allows developers to insert values into strings quickly and easily. The String.format() method and the + operator are two of the most common methods for variable interpolation in Java.
