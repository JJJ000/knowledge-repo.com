[TOC]

### Option 1: Optional
Java 8 added the [Optional](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Optional.html) class which can be used for null-safe operations. 

Optional provides a few methods for handling null values, such as `orElse`, `orElseGet`, and `orElseThrow`. These methods can be used to provide a default value, a computed value, or an exception in the case of a null value.

### Option 2: Java Streams
Java 8 also added the [Streams API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html) which can be used to perform operations on a stream of data. This can be used to provide a default value in the case of a null value.

For example, the `findFirst` method can be used to return the first element in a stream, or a default value if the stream is empty.

### Option 3: Apache Commons Lang
The [Apache Commons Lang](https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/) library provides the `ObjectUtils` class which contains several static utility methods for working with objects. 

This class provides the `defaultIfNull` method which can be used to return a default value if the specified object is null.

### Option 4: Guava
The [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) library provides the `Objects` class which contains several static utility methods for working with objects.

This class provides the `firstNonNull` method which can be used to return the first non-null argument, or a default value if all arguments are null.
