### Step 1: Add the @Deprecated Annotation

To mark a Java method as deprecated, add the @Deprecated annotation to the method's declaration.

### Step 2: Include a Deprecation Message

You can also include a deprecation message when declaring the method. This message will be printed when the deprecated method is used.

### Step 3: Replace the Deprecated Method

Once you have marked a method as deprecated, you should replace it with a newer, better version.

### Step 4: Remove the Deprecated Method

Finally, you should remove the deprecated method from your codebase once it is no longer needed.
