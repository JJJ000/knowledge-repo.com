### Timer

Timer is a utility class in Java which is used to schedule tasks for both one time and repeated execution. It is a thread that can be used to run a task periodically or after a certain amount of delay.

### ExecutorService

ExecutorService is an interface in Java which is used to execute tasks asynchronously. It is a framework that allows tasks to be executed concurrently using threads. It provides methods to manage termination and methods that can produce a Future for tracking progress of one or more asynchronous tasks.

### Advantages of Timer

- Timer is easy to use and provides a simple way to schedule tasks.
- It provides a way to run a task periodically or after a certain amount of delay.

### Advantages of ExecutorService

- ExecutorService provides a way to execute tasks concurrently using threads.
- It provides methods to manage termination and methods that can produce a Future for tracking progress of one or more asynchronous tasks.
