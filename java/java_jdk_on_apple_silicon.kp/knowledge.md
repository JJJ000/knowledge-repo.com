# Introduction

Apple's new M1 chip, and the Apple Silicon chips that will follow, are the first major shift away from Intel-based processors for Apple in over 15 years. The new chips promise to bring increased performance and energy efficiency to Apple's devices, but one of the biggest questions is how developers will be able to take advantage of the new hardware.

# Java and JDK Support

The new Apple Silicon chips are based on the ARM architecture, so they require different software than Intel-based processors. Fortunately, Oracle has already released a version of the Java Development Kit (JDK) that is compatible with the M1 and other Apple Silicon chips. This version of the JDK is based on the open source OpenJDK project, and it supports the same Java SE 8 and 11 versions that are available on Intel-based systems.

# Advantages of the JDK

The JDK for Apple Silicon chips has several advantages over the Intel-based versions. For one, the JDK is optimized for the ARM architecture, so it can take full advantage of the new hardware. This means that developers will be able to create applications that are faster and more efficient than they would be on Intel-based systems.

Additionally, the JDK for Apple Silicon chips includes support for the Swift programming language. This means that developers will be able to write applications in Swift, which is Apple's preferred language for developing applications for their platforms.

# Conclusion

The JDK for Apple Silicon chips is an important step in ensuring that developers can take full advantage of the new hardware. The JDK is optimized for the ARM architecture, and it includes support for Swift, making it easier for developers to create applications for Apple's platforms. With the JDK, developers will be able to create applications that are faster and more efficient than on Intel-based systems.
