### JSF
JavaServer Faces (JSF) is a Java-based web application framework intended to simplify development integration of web-based user interfaces. It was formalized as a standard through the Java Community Process and is part of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition.

### Servlet
A servlet is a Java class that is used to extend the capabilities of a server. It runs within the server environment and is used to process and respond to client requests. Servlets are commonly used to process or store data submitted from HTML forms, provide dynamic content, or manage sessions.

### JSP
JavaServer Pages (JSP) is a server-side technology used to create dynamic web pages. It is based on the Java programming language and is part of the Java Platform, Enterprise Edition. JSPs are compiled into Java servlets at runtime and can be used to create HTML, XML, or other documents.
