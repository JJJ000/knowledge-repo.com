### Definition

CharSequence is an interface in Java which represents a sequence of characters. String, on the other hand, is an implementation of the CharSequence interface.

### Usage

CharSequence is used to define the behavior of a sequence of characters. It is used to represent the sequence of characters in an abstract way. String, on the other hand, is used to represent an immutable sequence of characters.

### Difference

The main difference between CharSequence and String is that CharSequence is an interface and String is an implementation of the CharSequence interface. Another difference is that CharSequence is a mutable sequence of characters whereas String is an immutable sequence of characters.
