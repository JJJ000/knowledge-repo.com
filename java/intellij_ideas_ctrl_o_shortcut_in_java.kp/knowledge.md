### Shortcut
Ctrl+F12

### Description
This shortcut opens the "Structure" window in IntelliJ IDEA, which displays an outline of the current file in the editor. This view is similar to the Outline view in Eclipse, which is opened with the Ctrl+O shortcut.

### Usage
The Structure window helps to quickly navigate through the file, as it displays a hierarchical view of the file's structure, including classes, methods, fields, and variables. It also provides quick access to the code elements, allowing users to quickly jump to the desired location in the file.

### Benefits
Using the Structure window for navigation saves time and effort, as it allows users to quickly find and jump to the desired code elements in the file. This can be especially useful for large files or projects with complex code structures.
