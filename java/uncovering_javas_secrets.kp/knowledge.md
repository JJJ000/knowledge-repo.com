tldr: Java has hidden features such as implicit typecasting, automatic garbage collection, and operator overloading.

[TOC]

**Section 1: Annotations**
Annotations are a powerful feature of Java that can be used for a variety of purposes. Annotations allow developers to add meta-data to classes, methods, variables, and other elements of a program. This meta-data can be used to control how the code is compiled and/or executed, to provide additional information about the code, and to enable more powerful reflection capabilities.

**Section 2: Generics**
Generics in Java allow developers to create type-safe code that is more flexible and easier to maintain. Generics allow developers to specify the types of objects that can be used in a class or method, and provide compile-time type safety. This helps to prevent errors due to type mismatches, and makes code easier to read and maintain.

**Section 3: Enums**
Enums are a powerful feature of Java that allow developers to create a set of related constants. Enums can be used to represent a set of states, or a set of options that a user can select from. Enums provide compile-time type safety, and make code easier to read and maintain.

**Section 4: Autoboxing & Unboxing**
Autoboxing and unboxing are features of Java that allow developers to automatically convert between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes. This makes it easier to use primitive types in collections and other data structures, and makes code easier to read and maintain.
