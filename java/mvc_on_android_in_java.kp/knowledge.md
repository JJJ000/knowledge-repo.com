### Introduction 
Model-View-Controller (MVC) is an architectural pattern used in software engineering that divides the application into three interconnected components: the model, the view, and the controller. The MVC pattern is used in many different programming languages, including Java, and is especially useful in developing user interfaces for applications on Android.

### Model
The model is the component of the MVC pattern that manages the data and the business logic of the application. It is responsible for storing and manipulating the data, as well as for performing calculations and other operations required by the application. The model is often represented by a set of Java classes that encapsulate the data and the logic of the application.

### View
The view is the component of the MVC pattern that is responsible for displaying the data to the user. In Android applications, this is typically done with a combination of XML layouts and Java code. The XML layouts define the structure of the user interface, while the Java code is responsible for binding the data from the model to the user interface elements.

### Controller
The controller is the component of the MVC pattern that is responsible for handling user input and updating the model and view accordingly. In Android applications, this is typically done with an Activity class that implements the relevant user interface logic. The Activity class is responsible for responding to user input and updating the model and view accordingly.
