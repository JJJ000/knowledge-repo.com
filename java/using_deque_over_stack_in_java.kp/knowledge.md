#### Advantages of Deque over Stack
1. Deque provides more flexibility than Stack since it allows elements to be added or removed from both ends of the data structure.
2. Deque allows for more efficient operations than Stack, such as inserting or removing elements from the middle of the data structure.
3. Deque allows for more efficient search operations than Stack since elements can be searched from both ends of the data structure.

#### Disadvantages of Deque over Stack
1. Deque requires more memory than Stack since it stores elements in both directions.
2. Deque has more complex operations than Stack, making it more difficult to implement.
