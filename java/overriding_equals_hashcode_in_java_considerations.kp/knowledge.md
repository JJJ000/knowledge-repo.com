### Consistent Equals and HashCode
When overriding `equals` and `hashCode` in Java, it is important to ensure that both methods are consistent with each other. This means that if two objects are equal according to the `equals` method, then they must also have the same `hashCode`. Conversely, if two objects have the same `hashCode`, then they must also be equal according to the `equals` method.

### Performance Considerations
When overriding `equals` and `hashCode`, it is important to consider the performance implications of the implementation. The `hashCode` method should be designed to have an even distribution of values to ensure that hash collisions are minimized. Additionally, the `equals` method should be designed to minimize the number of comparisons it needs to make in order to determine equality.

### Use of Accessible Fields
When overriding `equals` and `hashCode`, it is important to use only fields that are accessible to the class. This means that private fields should not be used in the implementation of either method. Additionally, fields that are not part of the object's state should also not be used in the implementation.

### Immutability
When overriding `equals` and `hashCode`, it is important to consider the immutability of the object. If the object is mutable, then the implementation of both methods should take this into account to ensure that the object remains in a consistent state. Additionally, the implementation should also take into account any changes to the object's state that may occur over time.
