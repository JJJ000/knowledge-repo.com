tldr: One way to evaluate a math expression given in string form in Java is to use the Java Scripting API to parse the expression and evaluate it.

### Parsing the Expression
The first step in evaluating a math expression given in string form is to parse the expression into its individual components. This can be done using a combination of regular expressions and String methods.

### Tokenizing the Expression
Once the expression has been parsed, it can be tokenized into its individual components. This can be done by creating a list of tokens (e.g. numbers, operators, parentheses, etc.) and then looping through the expression to identify each token.

### Evaluating the Expression
Once the expression has been tokenized, it can be evaluated. This can be done by using a stack to store the numbers and operators, and then looping through the expression to evaluate each token.

### Outputting the Result
Finally, the result of the expression can be outputted. This can be done by simply printing the result of the evaluation.
