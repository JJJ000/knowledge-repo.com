tldr: Because they are shorthand for performing the operation and assigning the result to the variable, which does not require casting.

### Operator Overloading

The `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and `/=` operators are overloaded in Java to perform compound assignment operations. This means that the operations are defined to work with a specific set of data types. As a result, casting is not necessary for these operators to work.

### Compound Assignment Operations

Compound assignment operations are shorthand for performing an operation on a variable and then assigning the result back to the variable. For example, the `+=` operator is shorthand for "add the value to the variable and then assign the result back to the variable". Since the operations are already defined to work with a specific set of data types, casting is not necessary.

### Implicit Casting

In some cases, Java will perform implicit casting when needed. This means that the data type of the variable being operated on may be automatically converted to the correct data type when needed. For example, if an integer is being operated on with a double, Java may implicitly cast the integer to a double before performing the operation. This means that the casting is done automatically and the programmer does not need to explicitly cast the variable.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, the `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and `/=` operators in Java are overloaded to work with a specific set of data types and implicit casting may be performed when needed. As a result, casting is not necessary for these operators to work.
