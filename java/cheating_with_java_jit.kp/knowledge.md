### Introduction

Java JIT (Just-In-Time) Compiler is a technology used to optimize Java code. It is used to convert Java bytecode into native machine code at runtime. This allows Java programs to run faster than they would if they were interpreted directly.

### Does Java JIT Cheat?

No, Java JIT does not cheat when running JDK code. It is designed to optimize the code for faster execution. It does not change the behavior of the code or introduce any additional features.

### How Does Java JIT Work?

Java JIT works by analyzing the code and converting the bytecode into native machine code. This allows the code to be executed directly by the processor, which is much faster than interpreting the bytecode. The JIT also optimizes the code to make it run faster.

### Conclusion

In conclusion, Java JIT does not cheat when running JDK code. It is designed to optimize the code for faster execution and does not introduce any additional features or change the behavior of the code.
