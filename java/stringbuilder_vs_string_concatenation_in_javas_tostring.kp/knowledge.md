**Contents**

[TOC]

### StringBuilder
StringBuilder is a mutable sequence of characters. It is used to create a string object that can be modified. It is more efficient than String concatenation in toString() because it does not create a new object each time it is used.

### String Concatenation
String concatenation is the process of combining two or more strings together. It is done by using the '+' operator or the concat() method. It is less efficient than using StringBuilder because it creates a new object each time it is used.

### Advantages of StringBuilder
1. Faster than String concatenation in toString()
2. More efficient memory usage
3. Easier to use

### Disadvantages of StringBuilder
1. Not thread safe
2. Can be difficult to debug
3. Harder to read than String concatenation
