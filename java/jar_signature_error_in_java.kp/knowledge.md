### Cause
This error is caused when the signature file in the .jar file is invalid or does not match the file.

### Resolution
1. Check the signature file for any errors or mismatches.
2. If the signature file is valid, then check the .jar file for any corruptions or mismatches.
3. If the .jar file is found to be corrupted, then try to download the .jar file again and try running it.
4. If the signature file and .jar file are found to be valid, then try running the .jar file with a different version of Java.
