tldr: Using Jackson, a JSON string can be converted to a Map<String, String> by deserializing it into a Map object.

[TOC]

## Section 1: Import Dependencies
In order to use Jackson JSON to convert a JSON string to a Map<String, String>, you must first add the Jackson JSON library as a dependency. This can be done by adding the following line to your `pom.xml` file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.11.2</version>
</dependency>
```

## Section 2: Create ObjectMapper
Once the dependency is added, you can create an instance of the `ObjectMapper` class to use for the conversion. This can be done by adding the following line of code:

```
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
```

## Section 3: Convert JSON String to Map
Once you have an instance of the `ObjectMapper` class, you can use the `readValue` method to convert the JSON string to a Map. This can be done by adding the following line of code:

```
Map<String, String> map = mapper.readValue(jsonString, new TypeReference<Map<String, String>>(){});
```

## Section 4: Use Map
Once the JSON string has been converted to a Map, you can use it like any other Map. For example, you can access the values in the Map using the `get` method, like so:

```
String value = map.get("key");
```
