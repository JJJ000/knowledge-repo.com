[TOC]

## Eclipse
Eclipse has an automated way to generate getters and setters for a class. This can be done by selecting the class in the Package Explorer, then right-clicking and selecting Source > Generate Getters and Setters. This will open a dialog box with all of the class variables listed. From here, you can select which variables to generate getters and setters for, as well as other options such as whether to generate Javadoc comments. 

## Eclipse Marketplace
The Eclipse Marketplace also has a number of plugins that can be used to generate getters and setters. These plugins usually provide more options and customization than the built-in Eclipse feature. Some of the more popular plugins include GetterSetterGenerator, GetterSetterCreator, and GetterSetterFactory.

## Other IDEs
Other IDEs such as IntelliJ and NetBeans also have built-in features for generating getters and setters. IntelliJ has a Generate Getters and Setters action that can be accessed from the Code menu, while NetBeans has a Generate Getters and Setters wizard that can be accessed from the Tools menu.
