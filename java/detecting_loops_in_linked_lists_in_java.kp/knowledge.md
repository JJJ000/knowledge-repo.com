tldr: Traverse the linked list and compare each node`s next pointer to a previously visited node to determine if there is a loop.

#Section 1: Understanding the Problem 
A linked list is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence. Each node contains two elements: a data field and a reference to the next node in the sequence. In a linked list, the last node contains a reference to null, indicating that there is no next node. A loop in a linked list occurs when a nodeâ€™s next reference points back to a previous node in the list. This creates a circular loop in the linked list structure, which can cause unexpected behavior if the list is not handled correctly. 

#Section 2: Implementing a Solution
The most common way to detect a loop in a linked list is to use the "hare and tortoise" algorithm. This algorithm uses two pointers, one "hare" pointer which moves two nodes ahead of the other "tortoise" pointer. If the hare pointer ever catches up to the tortoise pointer, then a loop has been detected. This algorithm works because if there is a loop in the linked list, then the hare pointer will eventually traverse the loop and catch up to the tortoise pointer. 

#Section 3: Java Code
The following Java code implements the "hare and tortoise" algorithm to detect a loop in a linked list: 

```java
public boolean detectLoop(Node head) { 
    Node hare = head; 
    Node tortoise = head; 
  
    while (hare != null && hare.next != null) { 
        hare = hare.next.next; 
        tortoise = tortoise.next; 
  
        if (hare == tortoise) 
            return true; 
    } 
  
    return false; 
} 
```

#Section 4: Time Complexity
The time complexity of the "hare and tortoise" algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because the algorithm only needs to traverse the linked list once to detect a loop.
