Yes, Java Strings are Immutable

1. What is Immutability?
Immutability is a property of an object which cannot be changed after its creation. It refers to the object's state that remains unchanged over time.

2. Why is Immutability Important?
Immutability is important because it ensures that the state of an object remains consistent over time. This is especially important in multi-threaded applications, where multiple threads may be accessing and modifying the same object. By making an object immutable, it ensures that all threads will always see the same state of the object.

3. How are Java Strings Implemented?
In Java, strings are implemented as an immutable object. This means that once a string is created, it cannot be changed. Any operation that would modify the string will instead return a new string with the desired modifications.

4. What are the Benefits of Immutability in Java Strings?
The benefits of immutability in Java strings are numerous. It allows strings to be safely shared between multiple threads without the need for synchronization. Additionally, strings can be cached and reused, resulting in improved performance. Finally, strings are more secure, since they cannot be modified by malicious code.
