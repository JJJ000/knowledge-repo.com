### Using ColorBrewer

ColorBrewer is an online tool that can be used to generate distinct colors in Java. It provides a variety of color schemes, including qualitative, sequential, and diverging palettes. To generate N distinct colors with ColorBrewer, simply select the desired number of colors and the type of palette, and the tool will generate a list of unique colors.

### Using Random Color Generator

Another way to generate distinct colors in Java is to use a random color generator. This approach involves randomly generating a set of N colors, and then checking to make sure that each color is distinct from the others. If any of the colors are too similar, they can be adjusted or replaced with a different color.

### Using Color Hashes

A third approach for generating distinct colors in Java is to use color hashes. This approach involves taking a string and generating a unique color based on its hash value. This ensures that each string will have a unique color associated with it, which can then be used to generate N distinct colors.

### Using Color Schemes

Finally, distinct colors can also be generated in Java by using color schemes. This approach involves selecting a color scheme, such as monochromatic, complementary, or analogous, and then generating a set of colors based on the chosen scheme. This approach can be used to generate N distinct colors that all fit within a particular color scheme.
