tldr: You can use the Stream`s try-catch-finally construct to handle exceptions when working with exception-throwing methods in streams.

# Section 1: Overview

Java 8 Streams provide a powerful mechanism for working with exceptions thrown by methods. Streams can be used to wrap the exceptions thrown by methods and provide a more concise and readable way of handling them.

# Section 2: Wrapping Exceptions

The most common way to work with exceptions thrown by methods in streams is to wrap them in a try-catch block. This allows the programmer to catch any exceptions thrown by the method and handle them accordingly. The code below shows an example of how a try-catch block can be used to wrap a method call in a stream.

```
try {
    stream.map(x -> someMethod(x))
         .collect(Collectors.toList());
} catch (Exception e) {
    // Handle exception
}
```

# Section 3: Exception Handling

Once the exception has been wrapped in a try-catch block, the programmer can then decide how to handle the exception. This could involve logging the exception, throwing a custom exception, or simply ignoring it. The code below shows an example of how a custom exception can be thrown when an exception is thrown by a method in a stream.

```
try {
    stream.map(x -> someMethod(x))
         .collect(Collectors.toList());
} catch (Exception e) {
    throw new CustomException(e);
}
```

# Section 4: Conclusion

Working with exceptions thrown by methods in streams is a powerful way to handle errors in a concise and readable way. By wrapping the exceptions in a try-catch block and handling them accordingly, the programmer can ensure that any exceptions are handled in a consistent manner.
