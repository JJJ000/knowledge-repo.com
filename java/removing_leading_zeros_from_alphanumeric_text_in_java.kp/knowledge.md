1. **Using Regular Expressions**

Regular expressions are a powerful tool for string manipulation and can be used to remove leading zeros from alphanumeric text. To use regular expressions, the `Pattern` and `Matcher` classes from the `java.util.regex` package must be imported.

The regular expression `[1-9][0-9]*` can be used to match any alphanumeric text that begins with a non-zero digit. This expression can then be used to replace the leading zeros with an empty string, effectively removing them.

2. **Using String Methods**

Java's `String` class provides several methods that can be used to remove leading zeros from alphanumeric text. The `replaceFirst()` method can be used to replace the first occurrence of a regular expression with an empty string, effectively removing the leading zeros.

The `substring()` method can also be used to remove the leading zeros by specifying the starting index of the substring that should be returned. This can be done by using the `indexOf()` method to find the index of the first non-zero character.

3. **Using StringBuilder**

The `StringBuilder` class can be used to efficiently remove leading zeros from alphanumeric text. The `deleteCharAt()` method can be used to delete characters from the beginning of the `StringBuilder` until a non-zero character is encountered.

4. **Using Character Methods**

The `Character` class provides several methods that can be used to remove leading zeros from alphanumeric text. The `isDigit()` method can be used to check if a character is a digit, and the `forDigit()` method can be used to convert a digit character to its corresponding integer value.

These methods can be used in a loop to iterate through the characters of the string and remove the leading zeros. Once a non-zero character is encountered, the loop can be broken and the remaining string can be returned.
