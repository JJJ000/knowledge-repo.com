### Native
The `native` keyword in Java is used to indicate that a method is implemented in native code, typically in C or C++.

### Usage
The `native` keyword is used when declaring a method in a Java class. It is not used to declare a class or variable.

### Benefits
Using native code in Java allows for better performance, as native code is usually faster than Java code. It also allows developers to access system resources that are not available in Java, such as hardware devices and operating system APIs.

### Limitations
The main limitation of using native code in Java is that it is not platform independent. Native code must be written for each platform that the application needs to run on, which can be time consuming and difficult.
