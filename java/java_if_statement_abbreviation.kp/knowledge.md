# Explanation
The Java if statement is a conditional statement that executes a certain block of code if a given condition is true. 

# Example
For example, if the condition is that the value of a variable is greater than 5, the following code will execute:

`if (x > 5) {
  System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
} else {
  System.out.println("x is not greater than 5");
}`
