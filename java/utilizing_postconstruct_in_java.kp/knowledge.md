### Purpose 
The @PostConstruct annotation is used in Java to indicate that a method should be executed after dependency injection is done to perform any initialization.

### Benefits
Using the @PostConstruct annotation helps to ensure that any initialization logic is executed before the class is put into use. This helps to reduce the chances of errors caused by forgetting to initialize variables or calling methods in the wrong order.

### Usage
The @PostConstruct annotation should be used on methods that perform initialization for a class. These methods should be declared as public and should not have any arguments. The method should also not throw any checked exceptions.

### Example
For example, imagine a class that has a field that needs to be initialized with a value from a database. The @PostConstruct annotation can be used to call a method that retrieves the value from the database and sets the field.
```java
public class MyClass {

    private String field;

    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        this.field = retrieveValueFromDatabase();
    }

    // ... other methods

}
```
