### Using Thread.sleep()

The `Thread.sleep()` method is the most common way to timeout a thread in Java. It will cause the thread to sleep for the specified amount of time.

### Syntax

The syntax for `Thread.sleep()` is as follows:

```java
Thread.sleep(long millis);
```

Where `millis` is the amount of time in milliseconds for which the thread should sleep.

### Examples

The following example will cause the thread to sleep for 5 seconds:

```java
Thread.sleep(5000);
```

### Caveats

It is important to note that `Thread.sleep()` will throw an `InterruptedException` if the thread is interrupted while sleeping. Therefore, it is important to use a `try/catch` block when using `Thread.sleep()`.
