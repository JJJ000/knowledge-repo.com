tldr: Using `OR` statements in the WHERE clause is an alternative to using a PreparedStatement IN clause in Java.

**Option 1: Array of Values**

The IN clause can be replaced by an array of values. This option is best suited when the number of values is not too large. The following example illustrates how to use an array of values in place of an IN clause:

```java
String[] array = {"value1", "value2", "value3"};
String query = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE column IN (?)";
PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query);
statement.setArray(1, connection.createArrayOf("VARCHAR", array));
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();
```

**Option 2: Dynamic Query**

The IN clause can also be replaced by a dynamic query. This option is best suited when the number of values is large. The following example illustrates how to use a dynamic query in place of an IN clause:

```java
String query = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE column IN (";
String[] array = {"value1", "value2", "value3"};
for (int i=0; i < array.length; i++) {
    query += "?,";
}
query = query.substring(0, query.length()-1) + ")";
PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query);
for (int i=0; i < array.length; i++) {
    statement.setString(i+1, array[i]);
}
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();
```

**Option 3: Joining Table**

The IN clause can also be replaced by joining a table. This option is best suited when the number of values is large. The following example illustrates how to use a joining table in place of an IN clause:

```java
String query = "SELECT t1.* FROM table1 t1 INNER JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.column = t2.column";
PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query);
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();
```

**Option 4: Subqueries**

The IN clause can also be replaced by using subqueries. This option is best suited when the number of values is large. The following example illustrates how to use a subquery in place of an IN clause:

```java
String query = "SELECT * FROM table WHERE column IN (SELECT column FROM table2)";
PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query);
ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();
```
