tldr: Field Injection is the process of injecting data into a class field without using the class constructor, and it can be avoided in Java by making all fields private and using getter/setter methods to access them.

## What is Field Injection?
Field Injection is a type of injection attack that occurs when user input is directly assigned to class fields. This can allow malicious code to be executed, as the malicious code can be assigned to a field that is later used by the application.

## How does it work?
Field injection works by allowing an attacker to modify the applicationâ€™s class fields, which can be accessed by the application. The attacker can then use this access to inject malicious code into the application, which can be executed by the application.

## How to Avoid Field Injection in Java?
There are several ways to prevent field injection attacks in Java. The most effective way is to use a whitelist approach, which only allows specific values to be assigned to fields. This ensures that only valid values can be assigned to fields, and any malicious code will be blocked. Additionally, input validation should be used to ensure that all user input is sanitized before it is assigned to fields. Finally, it is important to ensure that all class fields are marked as private, as this prevents malicious code from being assigned to fields directly.

## Conclusion
Field injection is a type of injection attack that can allow malicious code to be executed by an application. To prevent this type of attack, it is important to use a whitelist approach, input validation, and to mark all class fields as private. By following these steps, it is possible to effectively protect an application from field injection attacks.
