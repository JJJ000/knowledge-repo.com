### Definition

The JPA hashCode() / equals() dilemma is a problem that arises when using the Java Persistence API (JPA) to persist Java objects. When using JPA, the hashCode() and equals() methods of the object must be overridden to ensure that the object is uniquely identified in the database. This can lead to problems if the hashCode() and equals() methods are not implemented properly.

### Problems

The most common problem that arises from improper hashCode() and equals() implementations is that the objects may not be uniquely identified in the database. This can lead to duplicate entries in the database, which can cause data integrity issues. Additionally, if the hashCode() and equals() methods are not implemented correctly, the performance of the application can suffer as the JPA provider may not be able to efficiently identify and retrieve objects from the database.

### Solutions

The best way to avoid the JPA hashCode() / equals() dilemma is to ensure that the hashCode() and equals() methods are implemented correctly. This can be done by following the guidelines provided by the JPA provider. Additionally, it is important to ensure that the hashCode() and equals() methods are updated whenever the object's state changes. This will ensure that the object is always uniquely identified in the database.

Finally, it is important to test the hashCode() and equals() methods thoroughly to ensure that they are working properly. This will help to ensure that the objects are uniquely identified in the database and that the performance of the application is not impacted.
