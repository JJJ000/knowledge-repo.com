[TOC]

## Section 1: Getting Date from Java Date

In Java, the java.util.Date class is used to represent a date. This class provides methods to get the year, month, day, hour, minute, second, etc from a Date object. For example, the following code snippet can be used to get the year, month, and day from a Date object:

```java
int year = date.getYear();
int month = date.getMonth();
int day = date.getDay();
```

## Section 2: Comparing with Gregorian Calendar Date

The java.util.GregorianCalendar class is used to represent a Gregorian calendar date. This class provides methods to compare two GregorianCalendar objects. For example, the following code snippet can be used to compare two GregorianCalendar objects:

```java
GregorianCalendar cal1 = new GregorianCalendar(year1, month1, day1);
GregorianCalendar cal2 = new GregorianCalendar(year2, month2, day2);

int result = cal1.compareTo(cal2);
```

The result will be a negative integer if cal1 is before cal2, 0 if cal1 and cal2 are equal, and a positive integer if cal1 is after cal2.

## Section 3: Combining the Two

The two methods described above can be combined to compare a Java Date object with a Gregorian Calendar date. The following code snippet can be used to compare a Date object with a Gregorian Calendar date:

```java
int year = date.getYear();
int month = date.getMonth();
int day = date.getDay();

GregorianCalendar cal = new GregorianCalendar(year, month, day);

int result = cal.compareTo(cal2);
```

The result will be a negative integer if the Date object is before the Gregorian Calendar date, 0 if they are equal, and a positive integer if the Date object is after the Gregorian Calendar date.

## Section 4: Conclusion

In conclusion, it is possible to get Year, Month, Day, etc from a Java Date object and compare it with a Gregorian Calendar date in Java. The java.util.Date and java.util.GregorianCalendar classes provide methods to get the required information and compare two dates respectively.
