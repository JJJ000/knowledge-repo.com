tldr: To implement token-based authentication with JAX-RS and Jersey in Java, one can use a filter to validate the authentication token before allowing requests to access the protected resources.

### 1. Generate a Token

The first step is to generate a token. This can be done using a library such as [JWT](https://jwt.io/). The token should contain information such as the user's username, an expiry date, and a signature.

### 2. Authenticate the Token

The next step is to authenticate the token. This can be done by verifying the signature and checking the expiry date. If the token is valid, the authentication is successful.

### 3. Implement Authentication

Once the token is generated and authenticated, the authentication can be implemented in the JAX-RS and Jersey application. This can be done by adding a filter to the application that checks for the presence of a valid token in the request header. If the token is present, the request is allowed to proceed, otherwise the request is rejected.

### 4. Handle Exceptions

Finally, it is important to handle any exceptions that may occur during the authentication process. This can be done by adding error handling code to the filter, which will catch any exceptions and return an appropriate response to the client.
