1. Multiple Filters
Multiple filters provide a convenient way to chain together multiple operations on a stream. This can be used to filter out elements from the stream, as well as to perform operations on the elements that pass the filters. The advantage of this approach is that it is easy to read and understand the code, since each filter is clearly defined.

2. Complex Condition
A complex condition is a single expression that combines multiple conditions, usually with logical operators such as AND and OR. This can be used to filter out elements from the stream, as well as to perform operations on the elements that pass the condition. The advantage of this approach is that it can be used to express complex conditions in a single expression, making the code more concise and easier to maintain.

3. Comparison
The main difference between multiple filters and a complex condition is that the former is more verbose, while the latter is more concise. In addition, multiple filters are easier to read and understand, while a complex condition can be more difficult to comprehend. 

4. Conclusion
Both multiple filters and complex condition can be used to filter elements from a stream and perform operations on the elements that pass the filter. The choice between them should depend on the complexity of the condition and the readability of the code.
