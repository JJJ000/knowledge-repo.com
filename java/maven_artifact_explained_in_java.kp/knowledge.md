### Definition
Maven artifact in Java is a type of file that is used to store compiled Java code and its associated metadata. This type of file is created by the Maven build tool and it is used to store information about the project and its dependencies.

### Structure
A Maven artifact in Java is a JAR file that contains the compiled code and its associated metadata. The metadata includes information about the project, its dependencies, the version of the code, the license, the authors, etc. The JAR file also contains the compiled Java code and any additional resources such as configuration files, images, and other files that are needed to run the application.

### Usage
Maven artifacts are used to manage the dependencies of a project. Maven can be used to download the necessary dependencies for a project and manage their versions. It also allows for the easy deployment of the application to different environments.

### Benefits
Using Maven artifacts allows developers to easily manage the dependencies of a project. It also makes it easier to deploy applications to different environments as the necessary dependencies are already included in the artifact. This makes it easier to maintain the application as the dependencies are already included in the artifact and do not need to be downloaded separately.
