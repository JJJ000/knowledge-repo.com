# Benefits
A static nested interface can be used to logically group related interfaces and provide better organization. It can also be used to access the enclosing classâ€™s static members without qualifying the name of the enclosing class.

# Usage
A static nested interface can be used when the interface needs to be accessed from outside the enclosing class, and it is not necessary to access the instance members of the enclosing class. It can also be used when the interface is closely related to the enclosing class and needs to be accessed from outside the class.

# Syntax
To declare a static nested interface, the keyword `static` must be used before the interface keyword. The syntax is similar to that of a static nested class.

# Example

For example, consider the following code:

```java
public class MyClass {
    static interface MyInterface {
        // interface methods
    }
}
```

Here, `MyInterface` is a static nested interface declared inside the class `MyClass`.
