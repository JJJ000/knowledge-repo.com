1. Overview
--------------------
Java is a popular programming language used for a variety of applications. One of the key features of Java is the ability to utilize multiple cores in order to increase the performance of the application. In this article, we will discuss how to determine the number of cores available in a Java system.

2. Determining the Number of Cores
--------------------
There are several ways to determine the number of cores available in a Java system. The most common method is to use the Runtime class which provides access to the system's runtime environment. The Runtime class contains the availableProcessors() method which returns the number of cores available in the system.

3. Example
--------------------
The following example shows how to use the availableProcessors() method to determine the number of cores available in the system:

```java
int coreCount = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
System.out.println("Number of cores: " + coreCount);
```

4. Conclusion
--------------------
In this article, we discussed how to determine the number of cores available in a Java system. We looked at the Runtime class and the availableProcessors() method which can be used to get the number of cores. With this information, developers can create applications that are optimized for multi-core systems.
