tldr: Java does not offer operator overloading because it was deemed too complex and potentially confusing.

### Reasons
1. Complexity: Operator overloading can lead to code that is difficult to read and understand, as the same operator can have different meanings in different contexts. This could make debugging and maintenance of code more difficult.

2. Ambiguity: Operator overloading can cause ambiguity when two or more operators have the same precedence and associativity. This could lead to errors that are difficult to detect and fix.

### Alternatives
1. Method Overloading: Java offers method overloading as an alternative to operator overloading. This allows developers to define multiple methods with the same name but different parameters. This provides a way to define different behaviors for the same operation without the ambiguity of operator overloading.

2. Generics: Java also offers generics as an alternative to operator overloading. This allows developers to create type-safe code that can be used with different types without the need for operator overloading.
