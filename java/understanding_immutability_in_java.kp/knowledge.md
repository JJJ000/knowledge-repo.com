### Definition
Immutable in Java refers to objects whose state cannot be modified after they are created.

### Benefits
Immutability provides several benefits such as thread-safety, improved security, and better performance.

### Examples
Examples of immutable classes in Java include String, Integer, and BigInteger.

### Usage
Immutable objects are often used in multi-threaded applications, where their state cannot be changed by other threads. They are also useful for caching and memoization, as their state cannot be changed after creation.
