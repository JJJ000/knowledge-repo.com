[TOC]

### Javax
Javax is a set of Java APIs that provide additional functionality to the core Java language. It is a collection of packages, classes, and interfaces that are used to extend the functionality of the Java language. Javax is not part of the Java language, but it is part of the Java platform.

### Java Package
A Java package is a collection of related classes and interfaces. It is a way to group related classes and interfaces together. Packages can be used to organize related classes and interfaces, and they can also be used to prevent name collisions between classes with the same name. Packages can also be used to control access to classes and interfaces.
