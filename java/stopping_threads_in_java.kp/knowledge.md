1. **Interrupting the Thread**
Interrupting a thread is the most common way of stopping a thread. The interrupt() method can be used to send an interrupt signal to a thread. This will cause the thread to throw an InterruptedException, which can be used to stop the thread.

2. **Using a Flag**
Another way to stop a thread is to use a flag. This flag can be set to true when it is time to stop the thread. The thread can then check the flag periodically and stop when it is set to true.

3. **Using a Join Method**
The join() method can be used to wait for a thread to finish before continuing. This can be used to stop a thread by waiting for it to finish before continuing with the rest of the code.

4. **Using a Timeout**
A timeout can be used to stop a thread after a certain amount of time. This can be done by using the Thread.join() method with a timeout parameter. If the thread does not finish within the specified time, it will be stopped.
