### Scanner
Scanner is a class in Java which is used to parse primitive types and strings using regular expressions. It is widely used for parsing user input from the command line. It has methods to read data from files, the keyboard, etc.

###  BufferedReader
BufferedReader is a Java class used to read text from a character-input stream. It reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so as to provide for the efficient reading of characters, arrays, and lines. It is used for reading large amounts of data from a file.

### Advantages of Scanner
- Easy to use
- Supports primitive and string parsing
- Supports regular expressions

### Advantages of BufferedReader
- Reads large amounts of data from a file
- Reads data line by line
- Supports character-input streams
