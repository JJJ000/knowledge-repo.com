tldr: Use the ObjectMapper`s readTree() method to parse a JSON string into a JsonNode in Jackson in Java.

[TOC]

# Section 1: Add the Dependency

In order to parse a JSON string into a JsonNode in Jackson, you must first add the Jackson dependency to your project. This can be done by adding the following dependency to your ```pom.xml``` file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
    <version>2.11.0</version>
</dependency>
```

# Section 2: Create the ObjectMapper

Once the dependency has been added, you can create an ObjectMapper object. This object will be used to parse the JSON string into a JsonNode.

```
ObjectMapper mapper = new ObjectMapper();
```

# Section 3: Parse the JSON String

Now that the ObjectMapper has been created, you can use it to parse the JSON string into a JsonNode. This is done by calling the ```readTree()``` method on the ObjectMapper and passing in the JSON string as a parameter.

```
JsonNode node = mapper.readTree(jsonString);
```

# Section 4: Use the JsonNode

The JsonNode can now be used to access and manipulate the data contained in the JSON string. For example, you can use the ```get()``` method to access a specific field in the JSON string.

```
String fieldValue = node.get("fieldName").asText();
```
