### Prerequisites

Before attempting to change the maximum line length for auto formatting, ensure that you have the Eclipse IDE installed and configured for Java development.

### Accessing the Auto Formatting Options

In order to change the maximum line length for auto formatting, you will need to access the Eclipse IDE's formatting options. To do this, open the Eclipse IDE and navigate to the `Window` menu. From there, select `Preferences` and then `Java` > `Code Style` > `Formatter`.

### Setting the Maximum Line Length

Once you have accessed the formatting options, you will need to locate the `Maximum line width` setting. This setting will be located in the `Edit` tab, and you can use the slider to adjust the maximum line length to the desired value.

### Applying Changes

After you have adjusted the maximum line length setting, you will need to apply the changes in order for them to take effect. To do this, click the `Apply` button at the bottom of the window and then click `OK` to confirm the changes. The new maximum line length will now be applied to all auto formatting operations.
