# Solution

## Step 1: Create a List

Create a list of all the callbacks you want to remove from the Handler.

## Step 2: Iterate Through the List

Iterate through the list of callbacks and use the `removeCallbacks()` method to remove each callback from the Handler.

## Step 3: Clear the List

Once all the callbacks have been removed, clear the list.

## Step 4: Verify

Verify that all the callbacks have been removed by using the `hasCallbacks()` method.
