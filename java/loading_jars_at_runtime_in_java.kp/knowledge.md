### Understanding Class Loading
Class loading is the process of loading Java classes into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is a key component of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). The JRE is responsible for loading, verifying, and executing the classes that make up a Java program.

### Loading JAR Files at Runtime
A JAR file is a collection of compiled Java classes and associated resources. It is typically used to package multiple Java classes and associated resources into a single file for distribution. JAR files can be loaded at runtime using the Java ClassLoader. The ClassLoader is responsible for locating and loading classes into the JVM.

### Using a URLClassLoader
A URLClassLoader can be used to load JAR files from a URL. The URLClassLoader can be used to load a JAR file from a local file system, a remote web server, or any other URL. The URLClassLoader provides a convenient way to load JAR files at runtime.

### Using a ClassPathResource
A ClassPathResource is a Java class that allows you to access resources on the classpath. It can be used to access JAR files that are on the classpath. The ClassPathResource can be used to load JAR files at runtime.
