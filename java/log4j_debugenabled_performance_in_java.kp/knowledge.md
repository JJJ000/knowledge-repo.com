## Yes

Logging can be a costly operation, and when done inefficiently can significantly slow down an application. Checking `isDebugEnabled()` before logging can reduce the amount of processing and improve performance.

## How

When `isDebugEnabled()` is checked before logging, the application can avoid the processing of creating the log message if the log level is not enabled. This can improve performance because the application does not need to construct the log message if it is not going to be used.

## Benefits

The primary benefit of checking `isDebugEnabled()` before logging is improved performance. This can be especially beneficial in applications that use logging extensively. Additionally, checking `isDebugEnabled()` before logging can help to reduce the amount of unnecessary logging. This can help to reduce the size of log files and make it easier to find relevant log messages.
