## Section 1: Troubleshoot

NoSuchMethodError is a runtime error that occurs when a method cannot be found in the specified class or object. This can occur when the method is not defined or it is misspelled, or when the parameters passed to the method are incorrect. To troubleshoot this error, first check the error message for clues as to what caused the error. If the error message does not provide enough information, then check the code for the class or object to make sure the method is defined correctly. 

## Section 2: Debug

If the method is defined correctly, then the next step is to debug the code to find the source of the error. This can be done by setting breakpoints in the code and stepping through the code line by line to find the exact line that is causing the error. This can be done with a debugger or by adding print statements to the code to see what values are being passed to the method.

## Section 3: Resolve

Once the source of the error has been identified, the next step is to resolve the issue. This can be done by making sure the method is defined correctly or by changing the parameters that are being passed to the method. If the error is caused by an incorrect parameter, then the parameter should be changed to the correct type or value. 

## Section 4: Test

Once the issue has been resolved, the code should be tested to make sure the error has been fixed. This can be done by running the code and checking the output for any errors. If the code runs without any errors, then the issue has been resolved.
