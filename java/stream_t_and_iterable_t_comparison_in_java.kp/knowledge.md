tldr: Streams are designed to support sequential and parallel aggregate operations, which are not supported by the Iterable interface.

### Reason

Streams are an abstraction that allows for operations to be performed on a sequence of elements. Unlike collections, Streams do not store the elements they process. As such, they do not provide a way to iterate over their elements.

### Benefits of Streams

Streams provide a powerful way to process data in a declarative manner. Operations can be chained together to form powerful pipelines that can be used to filter, map, reduce, and perform other operations on a data set. Streams are also lazy, meaning that operations are not performed until a terminal operation is encountered. This allows for efficient processing of large data sets.

### Limitations of Iterable

Iterable provides a way to iterate over a collection of elements. However, it does not provide a way to perform operations on the elements. This means that if an operation needs to be performed on each element, it must be done manually. This can be inefficient and difficult to maintain.

### Conclusion

Streams provide a powerful way to process data in a declarative manner while Iterable provides a way to iterate over a collection of elements. As Streams do not store the elements they process, they do not implement Iterable.
