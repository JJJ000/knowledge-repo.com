### Performance Impact
Exceptions in Java can have a significant impact on performance. When an exception is thrown, the program must unwind the stack, which can be time consuming. Furthermore, when an exception is thrown, the program must handle the exception, which can also take time.

### Memory Usage
Exceptions can also have an impact on memory usage. When an exception is thrown, the program must create an exception object, which can take up a significant amount of memory. Furthermore, the program must store the stack trace, which can also take up a significant amount of memory.

### Debugging
Exceptions can also have an impact on debugging. When an exception is thrown, it can be difficult to determine the root cause of the exception. Furthermore, the stack trace can be difficult to interpret, which can make debugging more difficult.

### Error Handling
Exceptions can also have an impact on error handling. When an exception is thrown, the program must handle the exception, which can be difficult and time consuming. Furthermore, the program must ensure that the exception is handled correctly, which can be difficult to do.
