### What is a Spring Bean?
A Spring bean is an object that is managed by the Spring framework. It is created and initialized by the framework, and can be accessed and configured by the application. Spring beans are typically used to provide services and resources to other parts of the application.

### How Do Spring Beans Work?
Spring beans are created by the Spring container when the application is initialized. The container creates the bean and injects any dependencies that the bean requires. The bean can then be accessed and configured by the application.

### What Are the Benefits of Spring Beans?
Spring beans provide a number of benefits over traditional Java objects. They are managed by the Spring container, so they can be easily configured and accessed. They can also be easily shared between different parts of the application, making them ideal for providing services and resources.

### How Are Spring Beans Used?
Spring beans are typically used to provide services and resources to other parts of the application. They can also be used to create and manage components, such as databases and web services. Spring beans are also commonly used to create and manage components that need to be configured at runtime.
