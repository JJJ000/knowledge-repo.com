### Overview
Java allows developers to pass methods as parameters to other methods. This is known as method or behavior parameterization, and it enables developers to write more flexible and reusable code.

### Syntax
The syntax for passing a method as a parameter in Java is as follows: 
```java
methodName(parameterTypes -> methodBody)
``` 
Where `methodName` is the name of the method that is being passed as a parameter, `parameterTypes` is the type of parameters that the method takes, and `methodBody` is the code that will be executed when the method is called. 

### Example
For example, if we wanted to pass a method that takes two `int` parameters and returns an `int` as a parameter, we could write it as follows: 
```java
int adder(int x, int y) -> return x + y;
```
We could then pass this method as a parameter to another method, such as a `calculator` method: 
```java
int calculator(int a, int b, int (int x, int y) -> return x + y) {
    return a + b + adder(a, b);
}
```

### Benefits
Passing methods as parameters enables developers to write more reusable and flexible code. By passing a method as a parameter, we can avoid writing duplicate code for different scenarios. Additionally, it allows us to easily change the behavior of a method without having to rewrite the entire method.
