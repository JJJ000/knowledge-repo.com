##### Section 1: Prerequisites

Before attempting to convert an object array to a string array, it is important to understand the difference between the two. An object array can contain any type of object, including strings, while a string array can only contain strings. Additionally, the objects in the object array must be able to be converted to strings.

##### Section 2: Converting the Array

Once the prerequisites have been met, the object array can be converted to a string array using the `toString()` method. This method can be used to convert each object in the array to a string, which can then be added to a new string array.

##### Section 3: Iterating Through the Array

In order to convert the object array to a string array, it is necessary to iterate through the array and convert each object to a string. This can be done using a `for` loop, which will loop through each object in the array and use the `toString()` method to convert it to a string.

##### Section 4: Adding the Strings to the Array

Once the objects have been converted to strings, they can be added to a new string array. This can be done using the `add()` method, which will add the strings to the array one at a time. Once all of the strings have been added, the new string array will be ready to use.
