tldr: ArrayList initialization in Java is equivalent to creating a new ArrayList object and adding elements to it.

### Array Initialization
In Java, arrays are initialized by using the `new` keyword to create the array, followed by a data type and size of the array. For example, `int[] array = new int[5];` creates an array of type `int` of size `5`.

### ArrayList Initialization
In Java, ArrayLists are initialized by declaring the ArrayList variable and then calling the `ArrayList` constructor. For example, `ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();` creates an empty ArrayList of type `Integer`. Alternatively, an ArrayList can be initialized with a given size or with a given collection.
