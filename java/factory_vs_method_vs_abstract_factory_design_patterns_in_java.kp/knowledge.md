tldr: Factory Pattern creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic, Factory Method creates an instance of several derived classes, and Abstract Factory creates an instance of several families of classes.

### Factory
A Factory is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. The Factory pattern is used to create objects based on a set of input parameters or information. The Factory pattern can be implemented in Java using a static factory method or by using a Factory class.

### Factory Method
A Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. The Factory Method pattern is used to create objects based on a set of input parameters or information. The Factory Method pattern can be implemented in Java using a static factory method or by using a Factory class.

### Abstract Factory
An Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. The Abstract Factory pattern is used to create objects based on a set of input parameters or information. The Abstract Factory pattern can be implemented in Java using a static factory method or by using a Factory class.
