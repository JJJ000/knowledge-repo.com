tldr: Java does not support unsigned ints because it does not have an unsigned keyword.

### Technical Limitations

Java does not natively support unsigned ints due to its internal architecture. Java is built on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which is a stack-based architecture that relies on two's complement representation of signed integers. As a result, the JVM cannot natively represent unsigned integers, and Java does not support them.

### Design Choices

In addition to the technical limitations, Java's designers chose not to include native support for unsigned ints. Unsigned integers are less commonly used than signed integers, and the designers felt that the extra complexity of supporting unsigned ints was not worth the benefit.

### Alternatives

Although Java does not natively support unsigned ints, developers can still use unsigned ints in their code. For example, developers can use the BigInteger class, which supports arbitrary-precision integers, or the Integer class, which supports signed 32-bit integers.
