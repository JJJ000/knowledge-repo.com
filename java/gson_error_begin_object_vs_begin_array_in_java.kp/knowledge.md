**Introduction**

GSON is a Java library used for serializing and deserializing Java objects to JSON. It is an open-source library developed by Google. When GSON attempts to deserialize a JSON string into a Java object, it may throw an exception if the structure of the JSON does not match the structure of the object. One of the exceptions it may throw is "Expected BEGIN_OBJECT but was BEGIN_ARRAY".

**Cause**

This exception is thrown when GSON attempts to deserialize a JSON string into an object, but the JSON string is an array instead of an object. This means that the JSON string does not match the structure of the object and cannot be deserialized.

**Example**

For example, if the JSON string is `[1,2,3]` and GSON is attempting to deserialize it into an object, an exception will be thrown because the JSON string is an array and not an object.

**Solution**

To resolve this issue, the JSON string must be changed to match the structure of the object. If the JSON string is an array, the object must also be an array. If the JSON string is an object, the object must also be an object. Once the JSON string and object have the same structure, GSON will be able to deserialize the JSON string into the object.
