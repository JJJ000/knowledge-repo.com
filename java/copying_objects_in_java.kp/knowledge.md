tldr: The easiest way to copy an object in Java is to use the clone() method.

### Shallow Copy
A shallow copy of an object is a copy of the reference of the object, not the actual object itself. This means that any changes made to the copy will also affect the original object. To make a shallow copy of an object in Java, use the `clone()` method.

### Deep Copy
A deep copy of an object is a copy of the actual object, not just the reference. This means that any changes made to the copy will not affect the original object. To make a deep copy of an object in Java, you can use the `clone()` method in combination with a `for` loop to iterate through the object's fields and copy them one by one.

### Serialization
Another way to make a deep copy of an object in Java is to use serialization. Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes which can then be stored in a file or transmitted over a network. To make a deep copy of an object using serialization, you can use the `ObjectOutputStream` and `ObjectInputStream` classes to serialize and deserialize the object respectively.
