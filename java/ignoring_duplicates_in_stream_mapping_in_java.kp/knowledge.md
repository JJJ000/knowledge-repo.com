tldr: The stream can be filtered to exclude duplicate elements before collecting to a map.

### Using Set

One way to ignore duplicates when producing a map using streams in Java is to use a `Set`. A `Set` is a data structure that contains no duplicate elements. When producing a map using streams, a `Set` can be used to filter out duplicates before the mapping operation.

### Using Collectors

Another way to ignore duplicates when producing a map using streams in Java is to use the `Collectors.toMap()` method. This method takes two parameters, a `keyMapper` and a `valueMapper`. The `keyMapper` is used to create a mapping from the stream elements to the keys of the map, while the `valueMapper` is used to create a mapping from the stream elements to the values of the map. The `Collectors.toMap()` method also takes an additional parameter, a `mergeFunction`. This `mergeFunction` is used to specify how duplicate keys should be handled. By setting this `mergeFunction` to `(v1, v2) -> v1`, the `Collectors.toMap()` method will ignore duplicates and only keep the first occurrence of a duplicate key.

### Using Filtering

A third way to ignore duplicates when producing a map using streams in Java is to use filtering. This can be done by using the `Stream.filter()` method to filter out any elements that have duplicate keys. This method takes a `Predicate` as a parameter, which can be used to filter out any elements that have a duplicate key.

### Using Grouping

A fourth way to ignore duplicates when producing a map using streams in Java is to use grouping. This can be done by using the `Collectors.groupingBy()` method. This method takes a `keyMapper` and a `valueMapper` as parameters, similar to the `Collectors.toMap()` method. However, instead of creating a mapping from the stream elements to the map values, the `Collectors.groupingBy()` method will group the stream elements by their keys. This will ensure that any duplicates are grouped together, and only the first occurrence of a duplicate key will be kept.
