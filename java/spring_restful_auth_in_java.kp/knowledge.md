# Introduction
RESTful authentication is a way of authenticating users via a web application by using the Representational State Transfer (REST) architecture. It is a form of authentication that is designed to provide a secure and easy way for users to access a web application.

# Spring Framework
The Spring Framework is an open-source application framework for Java. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model for modern Java-based enterprise applications. Spring enables developers to create applications from “plain old Java objects” (POJOs) and to apply enterprise services non-invasively to POJOs.

# Spring Security
Spring Security is a framework that provides authentication, authorization, and protection against common attacks. It is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework. It is the de-facto standard for securing Spring-based applications. Spring Security provides authentication and authorization support for both web applications and RESTful web services.

# Implementing RESTful Authentication with Spring
RESTful authentication with Spring is done by using the Spring Security framework. Spring Security provides a comprehensive authentication and authorization infrastructure that can be easily integrated with web applications and RESTful web services. It provides a wide range of authentication mechanisms, including form-based authentication, HTTP basic authentication, and OAuth 2.0. It also provides support for custom authentication mechanisms. Spring Security also provides access control mechanisms, including role-based access control, which can be used to control access to resources.
