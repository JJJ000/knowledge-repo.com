### System.exit Called in Java

System.exit is a Java method that terminates the currently running Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It is a static method of the System class. When this method is called, the JVM will terminate immediately, without executing any further code. This can be used to terminate a program before its normal completion, or to terminate an application that has become unresponsive.

### VM Crash

A VM crash occurs when the JVM encounters an unexpected error, such as a hardware or software failure, and is unable to recover. This can be caused by a variety of issues, including memory leaks, resource exhaustion, and incompatibilities between different versions of Java. In the event of a VM crash, the JVM will terminate abruptly, without executing any further code. This can lead to data loss and other issues, so it is important to ensure that the JVM is stable and running the latest version of Java.
