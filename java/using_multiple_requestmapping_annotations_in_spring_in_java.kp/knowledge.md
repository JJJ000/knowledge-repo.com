tldr: You can use multiple @RequestMapping annotations in Spring by adding multiple mappings to a single controller method.

## Section 1: Understand the Basics

@RequestMapping is an annotation used in Spring to map web requests onto specific handler classes and/or handler methods. It is used to create a mapping between a URL path and an action to be taken when the path is requested. This annotation can also be used to map a specific HTTP method to a specific action.

## Section 2: Setup the Annotation

To use the @RequestMapping annotation, it must first be added to the class or method that will handle the request. This can be done by adding the annotation to the class declaration or to the method declaration. For example:

```java
@RequestMapping("/path")
public class RequestHandler {

}

public class RequestHandler {
    
    @RequestMapping("/path")
    public void handleRequest() {
        // Handle request here
    }
}
```

## Section 3: Use Multiple Annotations

Once the @RequestMapping annotation has been added to the class or method, multiple annotations can be used to map different requests to different actions. For example:

```java
@RequestMapping("/path1")
public void handleRequest1() {
    // Handle request 1 here
}

@RequestMapping("/path2")
public void handleRequest2() {
    // Handle request 2 here
}
```

## Section 4: Use Multiple HTTP Methods

The @RequestMapping annotation can also be used to map different HTTP methods to different actions. For example:

```java
@RequestMapping(value="/path", method=RequestMethod.GET)
public void handleGetRequest() {
    // Handle GET request here
}

@RequestMapping(value="/path", method=RequestMethod.POST)
public void handlePostRequest() {
    // Handle POST request here
}
```
