### Create a Constructor

The first step to passing a parameter to a Java thread is to create a constructor for the thread that takes the parameter as an argument. This constructor should be used to initialize the thread, and should be passed the parameter when the thread is created.

### Implement the Runnable Interface

The second step is to implement the Runnable interface in the thread class. This interface allows the thread to be executed, and provides the run() method which takes no arguments.

### Pass the Parameter

The third step is to pass the parameter to the thread by passing it to the constructor. This can be done by creating a new instance of the thread class, passing the parameter as an argument.

### Access the Parameter

The fourth step is to access the parameter within the thread. This can be done by creating a field in the thread class that stores the parameter, and then accessing it within the run() method.
