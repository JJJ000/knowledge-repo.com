### Get the POM File 

The first step is to get the POM file. This can be done by either accessing the file directly or by using a Maven API. 

### Parse the POM File 

Once the POM file is obtained, the next step is to parse the file. This can be done using a library such as Apache Maven, which provides an API for reading and writing POM files. 

### Extract the Version 

Once the POM file is parsed, the version can be extracted from the file. This can be done by using the Maven API to access the <version> element in the POM file. 

### Use the Version 

The last step is to use the version in the code. This can be done by storing the version in a variable and then using the variable in the code as needed.
